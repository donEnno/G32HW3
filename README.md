ADM repository for homework 3.

See main.ipynb for our results.

About the files:
- CommandLine.sh is our solution for the command line question. It operates in the merged.tsv file
- RankingList contains our solution for the algorithmic question
- All .pkl files refer to intermediate solutions to the research questions
- The merged.tsv and merged_places.tsv files contain the attributes to all the places.
- places.txt contains the URLs to all of the 7200 places
- The tfidf.zip is a zipped version of the tfIdf_df used in main.ipynb
- tsvs.zip contains all the tsv files that hold the attributes for the places
- Since the final plot is not displayed in the main.ipynb, we uploaded the visualization.png, that shows the plot for task 4

Group members are Michele Musacchio, Giovanni Sciocchetti and Enno Belz.
