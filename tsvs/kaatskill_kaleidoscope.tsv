0	Kaatskill Kaleidoscope	['Mount Tremper', ' New York']	222	600	"Built from a converted grain silo is the Kaatskill (spelled in the original Dutch way) Kaleidoscope, the world’s largest at 60 feet.
Designed by 1960s psychedelic artist Isaac Abrams—whose work has a distinctly kaleidoscopic look—and his son Raphael, the giant kaleidoscope was finished in 1996 and cost a quarter of a million dollars to build, money put up by local entertainer-entrepreneur Dean Gitter.
To view the show one walks through the local mall, and enters the kaleidoscope, where you lay on slanted, padded boards and look up. There are currently three shows, a holiday-themed one, a journey through the stars, and the regular “America- the House We Live In.” The silo was previously painted in a sky pattern with a face on it, but has since been repainted to black, with an ad for the mall it is attached to.
The gift shop contains all things Kaleidoscope, with fine-art kaleidoscopes going for up to a thousand dollars. Its neighbors now include a resort and spa."	The world's largest kaleidoscope, designed by a 1960s psychedelic artist. 	5340 Route 28 Mount Tremper, New York, 12457United States	42	-74	['ollie625', 'Anna', 'Minster', 'elizabetwilson47', 'andrewvolent', 'e1savage', 'Rob', 'Rachel', 'Trevor']	2010-06-28	['Leaning Tower of Tbilisi', 'Somerset Bridge', 'The Hermit House', 'Fortress of Faith (Greenback Castle)']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kaatskill-kaleidoscope
