0	Site of Boston's First Bell	['Boston', ' Massachusetts']	408	661	"Paul Revere continued to work as a successful businessman after the war, operating a bell foundry and copper mill.
Revere’s foundry on Foster Street near the corner of Commercial Street served many local businesses and created many bells, but none so special as the first. Here he learned how to cast bells and recast a cracked bell for his own church, the Second Church, creating the first bell ever cast in Boston.
Apparently it wasn’t a great first job. “The sound is not clear and prolonged, from the lips to the crown shrill.” said Reverend William Bentley.
At the Paul Revere house, the courtyard has a bell and a small mortar and a copper hull pin from the USS Constitution, made by Paul Revere & Sons."	The first bell ever cast in Boston was cast by Paul Revere...and sounded terrible. 	19 N SquareBoston, Massachusetts, 02113United States	42	-71	[]	2011-08-23	"['Birthplace of the Steamboat', 'The Atomium', 'The Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force Submarine Museum', '""El Gigante"" and the Stone Moai of Easter Island']"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/site-of-boston-s-first-bell
