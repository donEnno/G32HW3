0	Hidden Heart of Music Row	['Nashville', ' Tennessee']	198	742	"Starstruck Entertainment is one of the many iconic record labels on Nashville’s Music Row, founded in 1988 by Reba McEntire and her then-husband Narvel Blackstock. The company is known for having world-class recording studios and a focus on artist management and writer development, and the building itself features a unique design (not to mention a rooftop helipad). 
But there’s another feature specific to the building’s masonry that’s far less well known. Hidden among all of the rectangular stones that compose the southern wall around the building is just one of a different shape, a tribute to love and creativity."	It may take some time to locate, but it's sure to warm even a heart of stone. 	40 Music Square WNashville, TennesseeUnited States	36	-86	[]	2019-04-11	['Isthmia Prime Hotel', 'Myouryuji (Ninja Temple)', 'Gobbler Theater', 'Music Box Village']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hidden-heart-of-music-row
