0	'Bliss Dance'	['Las Vegas', ' Nevada']	677	658	"Once the centerpiece for all night parties surrounded by the thumping music and pulsing crowds at Burning Man, Bliss Dance was installed on Treasure Island in May of 2011 after her triumphant return from Black Rock City.
Marco Cochrane’s 40ft tall sculpture of a woman dancing was originally created for Burning Man 2010: Metropolis, in his Treasure Island studio. Back home after her desert adventure, she now towers above the island on the Great Lawn, dwarfing the cityscape of San Francisco, book-ended by the Bay and Golden Gate bridges behind her.
Weighing in at 7,000 pounds, Bliss Dance’s elegant form is constructed of triangulated geodesic struts, skinned in a steel mesh that reflects the sunlight. By night she is illuminated from within by 1,000 LEDs.
In October 2016 the Bliss Dance statue moved from San Francisco to Las Vegas after being bought by MGMGrand. Its new location is at The Park. Her sister, “Truth is Beauty,” can be found in San Leandro."	An enormous illuminated figure dances on the Las Vegas strip. 	3784 S Las Vegas BlvdLas Vegas, Nevada, 89109United States	36	-115	['skaules', 'tsarder', 'mrsgevy', 'Collector', 'of', 'Experiences', 'lstockhausen', 'aschnoebelen', 'alexbbypls', 'Rachel', 'Annetta', 'Black']	2012-06-27	['Traffic Light Tree', 'Pioneer Plaza Cattle Drive', '‘Corporate Head’', 'Gnome Island']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bliss-dance
