0	Le Cercueil (The Coffin)	['Brussels', ' Belgium']	450	939	"The gruesome ambience of this bar offers the drinker an immersive macabre lesson in hell-bent bar-hopping. 
Le Cercueil was unleashed onto the world in 1974 following the release of the horror movie, “The Exorcist.” The decor, featuring grim reapers and dark skeletons, creates a morbid atmosphere in this unique tavern. The only thing creepier than placing your skull-shaped beer mug on a coffin is the nomenclature of the cocktails. Sit back and sip on your choice of corpse juice, devil’s sperm, and vampire blood. The bar offers a speed-dating service but beware, the ultraviolet neon lights give potential lovers an eerie corpse-like appearance."	The Devil’s own choice when he needs a drink in Brussels. 	10 HaringstraatBrussels, 1000Belgium	50	4	['Collector', 'of', 'Experiences', 'CoolCrab', 'hrnick', 'Martin', 'Mordy', 'Rachel', 'Annetta', 'Black']	2013-07-22	['Elliott Street Deli & Pub', 'Velvet', 'Chowning’s Tavern', 'El Batey']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/le-cercueil
