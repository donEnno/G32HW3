Built in 1872 by the Steinway family to serve their rising piano empire, this 400-acre company town accommodated employees with their own amusement park, firehouses, schools, churches, horse-car railroads, and initiated the infrastructure of the 7 Train (then known as the Steinway Tube) and the Queensborough Bridge.
Today, the factory gives $20 tours from September through the end of June. They occur on Tuesdays and Thursdays. They run from 9:30 a.m. until noon. It still has 19th-century machines used to bend frames, people handmaking keys, and entire floors dedicated to wood incubators where materials are left for months at a time. The factory is responsible for the creation of over 2,000 grand pianos annually and is the only remaining piano factory in New York."	Piano-making empire filled with 200-year-old steam machines still churning out 1,000 instruments a year. 	1 Steinway PlaceQueens, New York, 11105United States	40	-73	[]	2013-03-28	['Black Sabbath Bridge', 'Foy & Gibson Factory', 'Birthplace of Buddy Guy', 'Birthplace of Country Music Museum']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/steinway-piano-factory
