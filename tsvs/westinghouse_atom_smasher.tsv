Built by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1937, “the atom smasher was the centerpiece of the first large-scale program in nuclear physics established in industry,” according to Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).  It remained in use until 1958. In 2015, the bulb was taken off of its pedestal and laid on its side in hopes that someone will eventually restore it. It is a symbol of Westinghouse’s early involvement in nuclear power, but also the fleeting nature of our technological work.	This icon of the Atomic Age now lays dormant. 	386-398 Avenue APittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15221United States	40	-79	['hilreaps', 'marilynbweber', '7d31c9ab', 'rolypolyprince', 'chasepopt', 'tomstrong', 'Keri', 'Kilgo', 'jmswisher', 'paulmatarrese']	2020-05-26	['Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant', 'Orlando Towers', 'Camp Century (Project Iceworm)', 'Icecap Ground Zero']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/westinghouse-atom-smasher
