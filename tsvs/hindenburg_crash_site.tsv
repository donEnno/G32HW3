During an attempt to land at Lakehurst Naval Air Station, the Hindenburg airship caught fire and disintegrated into a raging ball of fire near-instantaneously, in a display of rapid combustion unlike any other. Despite its enduring legacy as a horrific disaster, less than half of the people on board the Hindenburg actually died. 62 passengers and crew escaped with their lives.
A simple yet powerful memorial marks the site of the crash. A cement outline in the shape of the Hindenburg stretches across the airfield in the spot where the airship crash-landed in flames.
The site was declared a Registered National Historic Landmark in 1961."	The site of one of history's most indelible and horrific tragedies. 	563 Saniuk RoadLakehurst, New Jersey, 08733United States	40	-74	['tcgarner', 'neonmixtape', 'hana', 'Jane', 'Weinhardt', 'Goldberg', 'Martin', 'renkessler']	2013-01-27	['Texas City Memorial', 'Patsy Cline Crash Site Memorial', 'Mount Tamalpais Aircraft Crash Site', 'The London Beer Flood']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hindenburg-crash-site
