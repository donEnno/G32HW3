Opened in 1910, the Hermitage is located flush in the middle of downtown Nashville, and features a number of gorgeous period flourishes. None are so applauded as the Art Deco-styled men’s restroom off the lobby. The public lavatory is the head (so to speak) of its class, having even been awarded “Restroom of the Year” (a nationwide accolade given by bathroom supply kings Cintas) on a number of occasions. The lush bathroom is walled in gleaming lime-green-and-black leaded glass tiles, has lime-green fixtures, terrazzo flooring, and features a two-seat shoeshine station. Lest the beauty of the Hermitage’s septic architecture be lost on the fairer sex, the hotel now gladly welcomes women in to feast their eyes on the historic latrine."	This award-winning men's bathroom was just too beautiful to not allow women to see. 	231 6th Avenue NorthNashville, Tennessee, 37219United States	36	-86	['jgb', 'bradihooker', 'The', 'Traveling', 'Craig', 'cait7911', 'KenJ', 'calvinsehrt', 'Mark', 'Loftin', 'arc459', 'slmaynard26', 'Rachel']	2014-01-23	['Transparent Restroom', 'Prince of Wales Hotel', 'Hotel Casa Grande Wall', 'Pirelli Building']	['10 Bathrooms You Should Pee in Before You Die']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hermitage-hotel-mens-bathroom
