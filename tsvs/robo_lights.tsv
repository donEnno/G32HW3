Since 1986, Kenny Irwin Jr. has been building the sci-fi holiday spectacle which has turned into a year-round event viewable from the street, although it’s during the winter season that Robo Lights really comes to life with millions of lights and public access to the whole celebration.
There’s a post-apocalyptic scene with “nuclear elves” in the tennis court, and Santa’s sleigh, aka his “battlewagon,” is pulled by a team of 12 robotic reindeer, while nearby the wise men come laden with microwaves. One robot stands 50 feet tall, and others have microwaves or other bits of found materials embedded in their chests in this ever-growing alien landscape of outside art. 
Update as of December 2019: The Robo Lights will not be running this year, but may return in 2020
Update as of November 2020: Robolights is open but by appointment only."
