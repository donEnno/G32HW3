0	Höllgrotten Caves	['Neuheim', ' Switzerland']	123	921	"The cave system consists of twisted, tangled stone formations and murky subterranean lakes that take hours to fully explore.
The Swiss location has become such a legendary draw, the caves are lit with eery lights and adorned with safe footpaths to make it safe and appealing for visitors. As a result, these strange and fascinating caverns have become something of a tourist attraction, with tours and guides readily available."	These spooky and unusual stone formations create an underworldly landscape. 	40 BaarburgstrasseNeuheim, 6345Switzerland	47	8	[]	2013-01-10	['Grutas del Palacio', 'Benagil Caves ', 'Chinhoyi Caves', 'Moqui Cave']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hollgrotten-caves
