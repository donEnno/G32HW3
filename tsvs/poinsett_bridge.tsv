The bridge was named after Joel Roberts Poinsett, a prominent South Carolina resident who lived in the area was built in 1820 to connect the larger cities in the state to North Carolina and Tennessee. It is a simple stonework affair that features a medieval gothic archway running underneath it. The road reaches 130 feet across Little Gap Creek with a width of 14 feet across. While it is not the most grandiose bridge on record, its age and bucolic beauty have made it a beloved landmark, yet no one is quite sure who made the thing. However historians widely believe that the smallish expanse was designed by Robert Mills, the architect that would go on to design the Washington Monument, another simple landmark that will not be forgotten any time soon."	The oldest bridge in South Carolina may have been designed by the same man who created the Washington Monument. 	Callahan Mountain RoadTravelers Rest, South Carolina, 29690United States	35	-82	[]	2014-05-23	"['Dunn’s Bridge', 'Tower of Wind', ""Vauxhall Bridge's Miniature St. Paul's Cathedral"", 'Henderson Waves ']"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/poinsett-bridge
