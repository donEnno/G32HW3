0	Luna Parc	['Montague Township', ' New Jersey']	175	925	"Since 1989, when Ricky Boscarino stumbled upon the cabin in the woods and began transforming it into Luna Parc, it has been a massive work in progress.
Filled with mosaics influenced by Klimt, Gaudí and Hundertwasser, the house looks as if it had been plucked from some colorful dreamscape and deposited in the backwoods of New Jersey. Artist, designer and “King-o-Luna,” Ricky Boscarino, has transformed the house both inside and out, with the interior of the house covered in his collections of homemade lamps, bottle caps, Buddhas, taxidermy, miniatures, stringed instruments, stained glass and religious icons. Currently, Boscarino is collecting Mrs. Butterworth bottles and blue glass for new outdoor sculptures.
A skilled artist in many mediums, among other projects, Boscarino created a four-panel stained-glass mural for his bathroom depicting the journey of life from spermatozoa to skeleton. When not working on his house, Boscarino makes and sells art and jewelry (much of it miniature versions of everyday objects, though you can get a miniature fetus and enema bag in gold and silver) and throws two large parties a year in fall and spring.
Luna Parc is not open to the public except for during spring and fall open houses, but there is a virtual tour available on the website."
