0	Dibbles Quarry	['Elka Park', ' New York']	87	528	"It is a setting out of a fantasy.
A “throne room” in the middle of the woods, overlooking a vast valley vista. King and Queen thrones tower over 5 others that sit nearby. A raised firepit offers warmth as court is held.
Dibble’s Quarry was in operation until sometime around the late 1800s, and it is said that some of the bluestone quarried there was used for sidewalks in New York City. Long abandoned, this lonesome mountain of rock shards in the middle of nowhere has fantastically transformed in recent years. 
No one knows how it came to be – whether built by one person or many persons, over a summer, over many years – but thanks to these anonymous artists, the mysterious rooms, thrones, benches, fire pits, and even a sort of spiral staircase feel as if they could have been part of the landscape for centuries. And for all we know, perhaps they have."	An abandoned 19th century quarry in the middle of the woods, remade by unnamed wanderers into a massive series of rock thrones. 	Sugarloaf Moutain Loop 2Elka Park, New York, 12427United States	42	-74	[]	2013-10-21	['Providence Canyon State Outdoor Recreation Area', 'Rock of Ages Granite Quarry', 'Abandoned Hang-gliding Launch Pad', 'Parr Park Rock Trail']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dibbles-quarry
