0	Dublinia	['Dublin', ' Ireland']	452	765	"Located in what was once the heart of medieval Dublin, this excellent museum takes you through the history of the city, beginning in the Viking age with ship replicas and Norse mythology, into the Middle Ages and the horrors of the Black Plague.
In each of the four permanent exhibits at Dublinia, visitors are invited to try on the clothing of the era, explore recreations of typical homes, and learn through sight, sound, and touch. Wax figures help tell the story of everyday life in olden days Ireland, and a sprawling diorama of medieval Dublin allows a bird’s eye view of just how much the city has changed. 
Visitors are able to climb the newly renovated 17th-century St. Michael’s Tower and get a breathtaking view of the city, then cross the neo-Gothic archway connecting Dublinia and Christ Church Cathedral. From there you can explore over 1,000 years of history as well as the medieval crypt that stretches below the church. 
If you manage to plan a visit after April 2019, you’ll be able to experience Dublinia’s new Archaeology exhibit. Until then, simply enjoy the museum and its gift shop, plus a coffee shop bathed in rainbow light from the stained glass."	Experience what life was like in Ireland during the Viking and medieval ages. 	121 R137DublinIreland	53	-6	[]	2018-11-14	['Museum of Medieval Stockholm', 'Museu Frederic Marès', 'Archaeological Museum of Alicante (MARQ)', 'Museo Faggiano ']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dublinia
