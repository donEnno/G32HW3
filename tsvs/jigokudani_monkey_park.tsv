Snow covers the ground more than four months out of every year and the valley is lined with jagged cliffs, jutting over 2,500 feet into the air. 
The park is most famous for its population of Japanese Macaques, also known as Snow Monkeys, the most northern living non-human primates.
Sometime in the early ’60s these clever characters decided to test the waters of the natural hot springs, and they’ve descended from the forest to warm up in their steamy discovery every winter since. Some of the hot springs even reach temperatures above 122 degrees Fahrenheit, which is perfect for warming monkeys along with visitors to the region.
Although not technically a religious site, the Snow Monkeys are popular in Japanese fables and are believed to be messengers of the Shinto mountain gods and rivers. Although the region is remote, there is no doubt that seeing monkeys on a spa retreat is probably a surreal and spiritual experience all on its own."
