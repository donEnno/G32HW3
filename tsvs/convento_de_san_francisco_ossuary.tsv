0	Convento de San Francisco Ossuary	['Lima', ' Peru']	561	788	"Beneath the church at the Franciscan Monastery in Lima, Peru, there is an ossuary where the skulls and bones of an estimated 70,000 people are decoratively arranged.
Long forgotten, the catacombs were rediscovered in 1943 and are believed to be connected via subterranean passageways to the cathedral and other local churches. Both creepy and beautiful, they feature small grates scattered along the upper floor of the cathedral through which, while you are touring, you may look down at any given moment to see the artistically arranged dead illuminated."	The mortal remains of an estimated 70,000 people lie in the basement of a monastery in Lima, Peru. 	130 Jirón AmazonasPlaza San Francisco LimaLima, 15003Peru	-12	-77	['thesolotraveler50', 'chip520', 'perrylunageno', 'kostas1964ath', 'Collector', 'of', 'Experiences', 'Blindcolour', 'Martin', 'Rachel']	2013-10-22	"[""Santa Maria dell'Orazione e Morte"", 'The Skeletons of Waldsassen Basilica', 'Pomuch Cemetery', 'Church of St. Ursula']"	"[""Bone Houses: A Definitive Guide to the World's Ossuaries""]"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/convento-de-san-francisco-ossuary
