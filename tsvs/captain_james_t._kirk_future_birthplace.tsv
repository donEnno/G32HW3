In a private courtyard behind a small yellow house, now used as a salon, is the future birthplace of James Tiberius Kirk, captain of the Star Trek series’s Enterprise spaceship.
A stone tells us that the Federation of Planets hero will be born there in 2228 (although some online sites claim his DOB is 2238). In the meantime, packs of Trek lovers and various nerds meet there at the annual Trek Fest in the Iowa countryside. On those days, you can meet people dressed in space uniform alongside with the Amish locals who ride horses and don’t use electricity—the past and future meeting."	A place of great reverence for Trekkies everywhere, a hero's future birthplace. 	60 Greene StRiverside, Iowa, 52327United States	41	-91	['ianfleming0007', 'DJPellegrino', 'biodieselbarry', 'msugirl90', 'voyagehomemuseum', 'spencersaints', 'charollinger', 'chrisawhite00', 'falynnk', 'Martin', 'Rachel']	2013-07-07	"[""Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument"", 'The Haserot Angel', ""Tian Yi's Tomb"", 'Shah-i-Zinda Necropolis']"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/captain-james-t-kirk-future-birthplace
