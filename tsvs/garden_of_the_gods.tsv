This area has been in existence for millions of years and features a rock formation shaped like a camel and the amazing Devil’s Smokestack. The Observation Trail contains more sandstone rock formations and views of the entire Garden of the Gods park. This is a natural setting and can be hazardous if not careful while walking along the path."	In the Shawnee National Forest, amazing rock formations peer through the treeline.  	Picnic RdMountain Township, Illinois, 62947United States	37	-88	[]	2019-08-25	['Palisades State Park', 'Mawan Hidden Canyon', 'Basalt Plug', 'Tasmans Arch']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/garden-of-the-gods-3
