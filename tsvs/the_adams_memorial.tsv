0	The Adams Memorial	['Washington', ' D.C.']	349	597	"The Adams Memorial was commissioned in 1886 to honor Marian “Clover” Hooper Adams, deceased photographer and wife of novelist Henry Adams.
Adams, a socialite and respected amateur portraiture photographer, committed suicide in 1885 by drinking a photography developing chemical. After her death, her husband burned her papers and letters. He never mentioned her name again. 
After receiving a commission from Henry Adams, renowned sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens completed the memorial in 1891. The androgynous figure is not a likeness of Clover Adams, rather the shrouded figure represents the Buddhist perception of Nirvana, an inspiration Henry Adams picked up while in Japan. 
The memorial resides in Rock Creek Cemetery in Northwest Washington, DC. The statue is unmarked, but can be identified by the thick circle of bushes surrounding it. Pickup a cemetery map to find the memorial, or simply meander through this old and beautiful cemetery."	A haunting tribute to pioneering photographer Clover Adams. 	201 Allison Street NorthwestWashington, District of Columbia, 20002United States	38	-77	[]	2013-06-18	"[""Thomas Wolfe's Angel"", ""'Civic Virtue Triumphant Over Unrighteousness'"", 'The Girl in the Shadow Box', 'Grave of Caroline Walter']"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-adams-memorial-washington-dc
