It may seem like an unexpected location for a sake company, but California has had a history of Japanese rice farming for over 100 years.
The Takara Sake Company traces its roots back to Kyoto, Japan in 1842, and started its USA headquarters in Berkeley in 1982. By 1990, Takara was the United States’ biggest sake producer. The museum opened in 1998, and, in tribute to its Berkeley roots, the company added an organic sake line in 2000.
The museum includes tools from the 19th and 20th centuries used for making sake, and various information about sake culture and history. When sake was first developed 2,000 years ago, it was imbibed only during religious ceremonies. Luckily things have changed and you can visit the tasting room after the museum."	The only museum of sake in the United States is nestled in an unlikely California college town. 	708 Addison StreetBerkeley, California, 94703United States	37	-122	[]	2012-03-20	"[""Musée de l'Absinthe "", ""Brazil's Coffee Palace"", 'Booze History Museum', 'Baked Bean Museum of Excellence']"	"['Celebrate Asian-American History With These Eateries and Food Businesses', ""The Ultimate Guide to the World's Food Museums"", '38 Museums Devoted Entirely to Food, From the Delicious to the Disgusting']"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/takara-sake-museum
