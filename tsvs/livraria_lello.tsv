Its art nouveau façade hides a beautiful Neo-Gothic interior, with a stained glass ceiling, carved wood paneling, and a breathtaking, curvaceous staircase that stretches across the store. 
Designed by Xavier Esteves, over the windows can be seen figures painted by José Bielman, representing “Science” and “Art.” Along with a stained glass window bearing a monogram of “Lello and Brother” with their motto Decus in Labore (“Honor in Work”), are plant motifs and geometric shapes.
Opened in 1906, Livraria Lello is an established bookstore, but it has certainly aged well over the years. It is consistently named one of the most beautiful bookstores in the world."	One of the most beautiful bookstores in the world hides a neo-Gothic interior behind an art nouveau facade. 	Rua das Carmelitas 144Porto, 4050-161Portugal	41	-8	['nanpalmero', 'bfroman', 'obriendannie', 'hana', 'Vrielinkie', 'Max', 'Cortesi', 'Martin', 'dmikolajunaite']	2013-04-22	"['Renaissance Book Shop', 'Bonnie Slotnick Cookbooks', 'Book Corner', ""The Monkey's Paw""]"	['The Ultimate Guide to Wondrous Independent Bookstores', '16 Hidden Gems to Visit in Portugal']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/livraria-lello
