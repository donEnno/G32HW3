0	Helen's Bridge 	['Asheville', ' North Carolina']	512	1608	"Writer Thomas Wolfe walked under Helen’s Bridge many times while growing up and included it in a passage in his book, Look Homeward, Angel, but it is perhaps the lore surrounding the bridge that draws the most attention.
The arched bridge is made of quarried stone and was constructed in 1909 to provide access to the nearby Zealandia Mansion. The legend speaks of a woman named Helen who lived at or near the mansion with her beloved daughter. After Helen’s daughter died in a fire, the distraught mother hung herself from the bridge. Her anguished spirit is said to still appear when her name is called, although people who have attempted to raise her spirit have reported that their car will not start when they try to leave."	This bridge is haunted by the ghost of a distraught mother. 	201 Beaucatcher RdAsheville, North Carolina, 28805United States	35	-82	['Masterficus', 'froog776', 'Phantoms', 'Secret', 'sloveall', '1b806fe6', 'exploringwithesch', 'PushingUpDaisies', 'michellew', 'blueridgepat', 'Raven', 'Traveler', 'Martin']	2012-10-17	['The 11 Bridges of Wayne', 'Bunny Man Bridge ', 'Museum of the Old Bridge', 'Las Coloradas Bridge']	"[""11 Haunted Bridges That You'll Just Have to Cross When You Get to Them""]"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/helen-s-bridge
