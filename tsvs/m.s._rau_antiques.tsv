There are countless hyper detailed clocks, automaton animals, cabinets of autoplaying musical instruments, erotic boxes, jewelry of the famous,  paintings by greats such as Monet, Renoir, Norman Rockwell, and others, plus an etching by Rembrandt and a puzzling Enigma machine, a type of encryption device. You’ll also find furnishings inspired by palaces around the world, plus several sculptural works. As a top antiques dealer their inventory is constantly changing, but know that they will always have a lot of detailed regalia.
These are available for purchase, but you’ll need a big budget if you plan to take them home with you."
