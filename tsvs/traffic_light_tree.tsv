0	Traffic Light Tree	['London', ' England']	660	2236	"Once located in the junctions of Westferry Road, Heron Quay Bank and Marsh Wall, this traffic light mutation can now be found in BIllingsgate Market.
Designed by French sculptor Pierre Vivant in 1998, the eight-metre-tall stoplight was originally installed on the site of a plane tree that suffered and died from air pollution. Its changing patterns are meant to reflect the “never-ending rhythm of the surrounding domestic, financial and commercial activities.” The initial idea was to make the London Stock Exchange’s activities trigger the lights, but it was scrapped as it cost too much to put into practice.
The tall “Traffic Light Tree” changes its 75 sets of lights in a random order, much to the confusion of unprepared drivers. Indeed, when Saga Motor Insurance surveyed British motorists on the best and worst roundabouts in the country in 2005, the one containing the “Tree” naturally came up high on the ranking."	A student driver's nightmare. 	London, England, E14United Kingdom	51	0	['Fred', 'Cherrygarden', 'JackHudson', 'shmangela', 'Ranian02', 'aliensock', 'hrnick', 'SkareMedia', 'Jaszmina', 'Szendrey', 'Mark', 'Casey', 'mbison']	2009-11-26	"['Oz Park', 'Le Grand Rassemblement - The Grand Gathering ', 'Eclectic Menagerie Park', ""'Bliss Dance'""]"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/traffic-light-tree
