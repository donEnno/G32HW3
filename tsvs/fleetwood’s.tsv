Perhaps begin with a beverage at the bar. Then start digging through their collection of vintage clothing, you never know what you might find that you can’t live without. There’s also an outdoor patio in the back with vintage detritus. If you run into someone you can’t live without, tying the knot is simple. Grab a dress or a frilly 1970s tuxedo shirt and start a life together."	A wedding chapel, vintage clothing shop, and bar all under one roof.  	496 Haywood Rd Asheville, North Carolina, 28806United States	35	-82	[]	2019-06-07	['Santuário de Santa Luzia', 'Chapel on the Dunes', 'Mantua Cathedral (Cattedrale di San Pietro)', 'Abandoned Church']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fleetwoods
