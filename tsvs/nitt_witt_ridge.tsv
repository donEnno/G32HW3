The castle is comprised mostly of stone, cement, abalone shells, and beer cans. Other parts are “borrowed” remnants from the nearby Hearst Castle, where Beal worked for a time. The massive Nitt Witt Ridge includes stone arches and walkways, long decks and strange gardens, and emphasizes Beal’s great sense of humor and love of nature."	A house built from trash known as the poor man's Hearst Castle. 	881 Hillcrest DriveCambria, California, 93428United States	35	-121	['davetaramachin', 'Molly', 'McBride', 'Jacobson', 'kgibsone', 'Avoiding', 'Regret', 'Henry', 'wythe']	2010-05-16	['Pan House', 'Smith Mansion', 'The Flintstone House', ' Craig-E-Clair Castle']	['50 Strangely Made Houses In The United States']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nitt-witt-ridge
