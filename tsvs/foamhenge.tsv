0	Foamhenge	['Centreville', ' Virginia']	596	1260	"You know Stonehenge, the prehistoric monument in the English county of Wiltshire that is constructed with enormous stones. But do you know Foamhenge? It’s a full-size replica of Stonehenge made out of Styrofoam. You can find it in Centerville, Virginia (Prior to September 2016 the sculpture was located in Natural Bridge, VA).
Created by Fiberglass sculptor Mark Cline of Enchanted Castle Studio - and described by Cline as his greatest achievement - Foamhenge is an enormously popular roadside attraction. “About 15 years ago I walked into a place called Insulated Business Systems where they make these huge 16-foot-tall blocks,” Cline told Roadside America when he was in the process of completing the structure. “As soon as I saw them I immediately thought of the idea: ‘Foamhenge.’ It took a while for the opportunity to present itself, of course.”
Cline’s creation is an exact replica of the original Stonehenge, but many have said that it’s even more photogenic. The giant Styrofoam blocks photograph well - they look like real stone from even a short distance - but this Stonehenge sits not on a remote island, but on top of a bluff amid the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains.
Update September 2016: Foamhenge has relocated to a new location at Cox Farms in Centreville."
