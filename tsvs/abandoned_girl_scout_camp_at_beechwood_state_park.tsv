0	Abandoned Girl Scout Camp at Beechwood State Park	['Sodus', ' New York']	105	745	"The empty deteriorating cabins are reminiscent of an 80s horror slasher flick.
The Girl Scout Camp closed in the mid-to-late 1990s. Neither the town nor the state wanted the land, but the town ended up with it, and turned it into a “state park”, which, it seems, they immediately forgot about. The abandoned buildings include a mess hall, various cabins, vinyl-curtained lean-tos, a campfire ring, and even a swimming pool. The cabins feature much broken glass, bed frames that seem to have been ripped apart, and holes aplenty in the walls. Various graffiti lines many surfaces in the park, even trees.
As of fall of 2018, the town of Sodus is increasing security on the premises, to hopefully curb the vandalism.  Despite all of this, the park itself is quite beautiful, lush with greenery and tall towering trees, bordering Lake Ontario. Camp Beechwood is a great area to explore, almost completely flat, making it an easy walk. It is especially gorgeous in the fall when the leaves are full of color. In 2019, the state took over the park and temporarily closed it to visitors for a time after vandalism and a past fire.
Update April 2020: The park has a caretaker now, and is expected to open for free camping, for up to five days at a time."
