0	Curia Arcanum 	['Austin', ' Texas']	158	896	"Austin’s semi-official tag line is “Keep Austin Weird” and there are few places that exemplify this spirit more than this Victorian-style oddity shop.
Inside, curious wanderers can find everything from unique artwork to a taxidermied specimen of the mythical wolpertinger. The shop also plays host to a small library of mystical books and other oddities spanning the world obscura. Curia Arcanum shares the property with another curiosity shop, The Glass Coffin: Vampire Parlour, making this location a two-for-one tribute to the weirder side of Austin."	This eclectic Austin curiosity shop is home to all things strange and unusual.  	1006 S 1st StAustin, Texas, 78704United States	30	-97	[]	2019-11-08	['Curioporium', 'The Secret Chamber House of Oddities and Artwork ', 'Big Top Curiosity Shop ', 'Odd Mountain']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/curia-arcanum
