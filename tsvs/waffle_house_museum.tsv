The chain restaurant they founded, Waffle House, is now spread across the South, famously never closing their doors save for act-of-God weather events.
But the very first Waffle House did close its doors for a time, serving as a series of other businesses before the company bought it back and opened a private museum in the building in 2008. From the outside, it looks like a Waffle House, often tricking passersby to come in search of hash browns. But the museum doesn’t serve any food. Instead, the interior is a faithful recreation of the original 1955 restaurant, along with several decades of Waffle House memorabilia."	A late-night restaurant empire was launched from this humble storefront. 	2719 E College AveDecatur, Georgia, 30030United States	33	-84	[]	2021-01-20	['Modern Diner ', 'Franks Diner', 'Harland Sanders Cafe and Museum', 'Original Pizza Hut']	['Taste History at These 7 Fast-Food Firsts']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/waffle-house-museum
