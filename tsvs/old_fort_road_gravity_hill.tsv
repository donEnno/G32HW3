0	Old Fort Road Gravity Hill	['Klamath Falls', ' Oregon']	138	923	"A strange stretch of road, or spot specifically, on Old Fort Road where gravity appears to work in reverse. Pour out water and it runs up hill, cars roll up hill too. While repaving changed the effect somewhat, it still works - particularly at night. There are hundreds of local folklore reasons why it occurs. The event starts roughly 50 yards up the hill (east) from the Old Fort Road gravel quarry on the right, down the hill approx. 3/8 of a mile down from the site of a WWII military medical base at the crest of the hill. 
Update: As of August 2019, the strange occurrence on this stretch of road has been fixed by the state of Oregon."	This strange hill on Old Fort Road where gravity works in reverse has been fascinating locals for years. 	1962 Old Fort RdKlamath Falls, Oregon, 97603United States	42	-121	[]	2012-03-26	['Kilt Rock and Mealt Falls', 'Spook Hill', 'Slumgullion Earthflow', 'Looking Glass Rock']	['12 Bewildering Hills Where Gravity Seems to Work in Reverse']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gravity-hill
