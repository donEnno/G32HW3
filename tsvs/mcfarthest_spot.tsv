0	McFarthest Spot	['Tonopah', ' Nevada']	68	596	"With over 13,000 McDonalds locations (or roughly one for every 23,000 Americans), this is Fast Food Nation’s version of the Alamo.
Geographically speaking, in the lower 48 United States it is impossible to get farther away from a McDonald’s restaurant than this location in Nevada. The McFarthest Spot it would take 135 miles of driving (only 120 miles as the crow flies) before a visitor could devour their next “two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun.”
During the next road trip traversing the extraterrestrial highway, pay some respect to the pioneers by taking the scenic route. Upon arrival, inhale and enjoy the lack of fryer grease in the air. Listen to the lack of crackle through a drive-thru speaker. Note the lack of clowns. You’re loving it."	The farthest you can be in the contiguous U.S. from a McDonald's location. 	Tonopah, Nevada, 89049United States	37	-116	['rakster', 'slgwv', 'linkogecko', 'yourself440', 'noblekeyser', 'erjeffery', 'Martin', 'mbison', 'stilldavid']	2009-11-19	"['Green Thumb', ""Cactus Joe's Blue Diamond Nursery"", 'Huntsman & Sons', 'Curioporium']"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mcfarthest-spot-skb
