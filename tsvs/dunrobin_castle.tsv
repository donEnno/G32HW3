The Castle was used as a Naval Hospital during World War I, and a boarding school from 1965 to 1972. It is the most Northerly of Scotland’s castles and the largest in the Northern Highlands with 189 rooms. It has been continuously inhabited since the 1300s.
After a tour of the castle, be sure to descend into the lush gardens behind the castle. Follow the trails all the way to the Moray of Firth. In the left-hand corner of the gardens, you will be witness to one of the oldest sports in Europe, Falconry. The magnificent birds fly freely from tree to tree and have a special bond with the man who raised them all from hatchlings."
