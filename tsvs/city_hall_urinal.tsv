0	City Hall Urinal	['Amsterdam', ' Netherlands']	703	691	"There are plenty of public places to pee in Amsterdam—if you’re a man, that is. There are urinals scattered throughout the city’s streets. Some look like strange silver structures; others resemble large green garbage bins.
But only one esteemed urinal has been granted national monument status. This toilet overlooks the canal outside the building that once housed the new wing of City Hall. Though the urinal was built in 1926, it wasn’t deemed a national monument until the 21st century.
It’s a rather pretty structure, befitting of the City Hall users it was built for. Its brick and stone base make it blend in with the nearby architecture. A stone statue rests atop its roof, overlooking its entrance. When viewed from the outside, there’s little indication that the interior air is saturated with the scent of pee.
The urinal is one of the 35 comfort stations available to male pedestrians with full bladders. In contrast, there are only three public bathrooms available for women. This discrepancy made headlines around the world after feminists rallied around a woman who appeared in court after being caught urinating in the street due to a lack of nearby facilities."	A public urinal so pretty, it was declared a national monument. 	195-197 Oudezijds VoorburgwalAmsterdamNetherlands	52	4	[]	2017-12-12	"[""Leiden's Monumental Urinal"", 'Democracy Monument', 'Transparent Restroom', 'Frank Lloyd Wright Spire']"	['10 Bathrooms You Should Pee in Before You Die']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/city-hall-urinal
