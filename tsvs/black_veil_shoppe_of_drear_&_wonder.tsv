The Black Veil also has plenty of photo-ops, and homes for many artist creators, apothecaries, and jewelers from around the globe. A beautifully grim experience for those coming to experience Salem, Massachusetts.	Like stepping into a spooky fairy-tale, this shop carries the dark ideas of artists and other makers.  	137 Boston StSalem, Massachusetts, 01970United States	42	-70	[]	2020-06-23	"[""LaBeL RéCuP'"", 'Redux Boutique and Gallery', 'Green Thumb', ""Cactus Joe's Blue Diamond Nursery""]"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-black-veil-shoppe-of-drear-wonder
