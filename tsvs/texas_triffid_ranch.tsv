In its current location, since March 2017, the Triffid Ranch specializes in custom unique enclosures for Asian, South American, and Australian pitcher plants (genera Nepenthes, Heliamphora, and Cephalotus, respectively), sundews (Drosera), butterworts (Pinguicula), bladderworts (Utricularia), and other carnivores, both on commission and based on owner/operator Paul Riddell’s background in science and science fiction art."
