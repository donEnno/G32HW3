0	Gates of Hell Hacienda Heights	['Hacienda Heights', ' California']	113	541	"Rumored to have once been the location of a sanatorium back in the 1940s, the hospital was reportedly shut down due to multiple cases of malpractice.
The property has since been fenced off for about a decade, with rolls of barbed wire suspiciously inside the fence, as if to keep something or someone in. The Gates themselves instill a feeling of dread and no one seems to know why the property is fenced up and under close supervision. It’s not uncommon to hear voices or subtle footsteps crunching through the brush near the property."	This mysterious and creepy location instills a strong sense of foreboding in all visitors.  	2903-3089 Descending DrHacienda Heights, California, 91745United States	33	-118	[]	2020-03-01	['Old Headquarters Historic Monument ', 'Jekyll Island Amphitheater ', 'Kiosk Ghost Town', 'Farol da Ponta dos Rosais']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gates-of-hell-hacienda-heights
