Constructed circa 1740 (The South Carolina Department of Archives and History) some of the planters who attended St. Helena Parish in Beaufort could not make the long trip to town each week, so a “chapel of ease” was built as a more convenient place to worship. Set among oak trees laden with Spanish moss, only the church walls and small cemetery remain. Local lore has it that the ruins are haunted."	The remains of a chapel created for convenience. 	17 Lands End RoadSt. Helena Island, South CarolinaUnited States	32	-80	['zannchann', 'timelesscreations', 'breaingram', 'poppet8', 'alysonsousa1', 'leslipeterson', 'Rachel']	2013-12-19	"['Santa Maria della Lode in Vescovio', ""St Ninian's Chapel"", 'Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church', 'Santuario del Señor de las Peñas']"	['The Ruins of South Carolina']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/st-helena-parish-chapel-of-ease-ruins
