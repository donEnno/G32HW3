0	Antelope Canyon	['Page', ' Arizona']	1222	4846	"Frequently subject to flash floods, Antelope Canyon can only be visited through guided tours because of the extreme danger. Still, it has managed to become the most photographed and most-visited slot canyon in all of the American Southwest due to its beauty and a peculiar phenomenon of natural light beams.
Formed by millions of years of wind and water erosion, Antelope Canyon’s magnificent smooth and flowing shaped sandstone has made it one of the most famous slot canyons in the world.
Located within the LeChee Chapter of the Navajo Nation in Arizona, Antelope Canyon is actually two separate canyons, the upper canyon and lower canyon. The upper canyon, which the Navajo call Tsé bighánílíní (“the place where water runs through rocks”), is a narrow passage through 120-foot-high canyon walls. The lower canyon is known as Hazdistazí (“spiral rock arches”) and is a shallower V-shaped canyon that is a more difficult trek for visitors."
