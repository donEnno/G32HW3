0	Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine	['Kyoto', ' Japan']	1985	1746	"Built in 711, the Fushimi Inari Shrine is the most famous of several thousand shrines dedicated to Inari, the Shinto God of rice. 
Foxes are thought to be the messengers of Inari and as such many fox statues can be found at Inari shrines. The foxes are sometimes seen holding keys in their mouths, the key to the rice granaries. Japanese merchants, in particular, worship Inari to bring them wealth and leave numerous offerings at the shrines.
Fushimi Inari Shrine is also famous for its countless torii gates, offerings by worshippers, that cover the hiking trails of Inarisan, and the wooded mountain behind the shrine’s main buildings, also named Inari.
These torii gates envelope a path that winds over 2.5 miles up the Inari mountain. You’ll notice that on each torii there is kanji writing. On one side of the torii gates, you’ll see the name of the person or organization that donated it as well as the date that it was donated. The oldest gates there are said to be from the 8th century and new ones are being added frequently.
 It takes about two hours to walk along the whole trail. Film buffs might recognize this location because parts of the movie Memoirs of a Geisha were shot here."
