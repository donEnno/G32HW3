0	Spitzhäuschen	['Bernkastel-Kues', ' Germany']	211	652	"Built in 1416, this distinctive building has been described as “the most photographed building in Bernkastel-Kues,” and with good reason.
The base of the house is extremely narrow, with the upper floors jettied out wider, making this 600-year-old home look like it is about to come crashing down at any minute.
The home was originally built this way to allow for wagons to travel through the narrow alley running alongside the building. As well, tax payments in many cities in Germany were based on the area of the foundation of the building, which explains why “jettied” buildings were a common occurrence in medieval Germany, as taxes were not charged on wider upper levels. 
The building has been home to a wine bar since the 1970’s and is still open to the public."	This 600-year-old home seems to defy physics.  	13 KarlstraßeBernkastel-KuesGermany	49	7	[]	2016-08-26	['Polychrome Historic District', 'Stone Mansion', 'John Burroughs Woodchuck Lodge', 'Olander Banks Sr. and Margaret Lomax Banks Community Park']	['8 Geometrical Wonders That Are Also Houses']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/spitzhauschen
