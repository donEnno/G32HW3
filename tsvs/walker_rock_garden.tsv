For 20 years, the Walkers painstakingly laid the stones both large and small to transform their garden into a unique and detailed art piece. Limited viewing hours make experiencing this treasure challenging, but the garden rewards those who are persistent. Mr. and Mrs. Walker have passed away, but the property is maintained by their daughter Sandy Adams.
Sculptures include an 18-foot-tall tower, intricate mosaics, a bench, mini mountain ranges, butterfly-shaped pavers, geodes, and more.
Update: This place has closed as of 2014.  The property was sold."	A Boeing mechanic and his wife leave a whimsical, stone sculptured garden as their legacy. 	5407 37th Ave SWSeattle, Washington, 98136United States	47	-122	[]	2012-07-08	"[""Rustic Canyon's Murphy Ranch"", 'Flintstones Bedrock City', 'V.
