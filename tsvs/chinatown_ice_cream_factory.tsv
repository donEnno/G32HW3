For nearly 30 years, the Factory has been offering a cold treat and has grown wildly popular due to their unique flavors. Wasabi, black sesame and peanut butter and jelly are just a few of the one-of-a kind ice cream options at the Chinatown institution. Walking into the building, the ice cream case dares those who enter to step outside their chocolate chip box and enter a new world of Chinatown flavor."
