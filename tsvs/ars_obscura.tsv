0	Ars Obscura	['Seattle', ' Washington']	168	706	"Down in the empty brick arcades of the Grand Central Building basement is the Ars Obscure Bookbinding and Restoration Company. Inside the small shop, the centuries-old profession of bookbinding is alive and well.
The operation is festooned with hanging leathers, excitingly chunky metal presses, and a host of other equipment that hail from a distant time and place outside the quotidian and modern. If you’re lucky, the quiet owner may be in and working. A small selection of notebooks and other handbound items are for sale, but the shop also specializes in restoring and binding historical works and grimoires. Also, there is almost always a bouquet of free, magnificently marbled paper bookmarkers for visitors."	In this subterranean brick arcade, a small shop continues the ancient practice of bookbinding.  	214 1st Ave S#B-11Seattle, Washington, 98104United States	47	-122	[]	2019-08-28	['The Ancient Books of Wales', 'For Keeps Bookstore', 'Coal Creek Library', 'Suzzallo Library Reading Room']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ars-obscura
