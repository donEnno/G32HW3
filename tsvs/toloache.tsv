0	Toloache	['Manhattan', ' New York']	194	591	"Every day, probably even every minute, some food item with mold is thrown out.
Just how much kitchen clean-up is necessary is a question Toloache has begun to ask. This Mexican restaurant serves up a delicacy punctuated with a growth most people are not accustomed. The corn-mold tacos, called huitlacoche, have become a crowd favorite, but has long been appreciated by the Mexican people.
Huitlacoche is technically a corn infected by a pathogenic fungus and where you’d think farmers would lament there crops being covered in black spores they actually rejoice and can then charge a lot more for their product. The taste is corn like with a much more earthy quality like a mushroom.
Toloache also servers another rare to find in the U.S. treat, chapulines tacos, a taco filled with Oaxacan style dried grasshoppers. Whether you’re feeling in the mood for moldy corn, seasoned grasshoppers or some of the other creative menu items, Toloache is a great place to explore another side of Mexican cuisine."
