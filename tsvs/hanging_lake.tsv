0	Hanging Lake	['Glenwood Springs', ' Colorado']	852	3738	"1,000 feet up the steep walls of Glenwood Canyon there hides away a basin full of water the color of Paris Green, waterfalls roaring near the fragile shoreline of travertine, the bottom of the lake fully visible through crystal clear waters.
Discovered by a gold hunting prospector, Hanging Lake was a private homestead and family retreat until falling into the hands of Glenwood Springs in 1910. Protected by the White River Forest Service, this is a popular stop for those willing to take a short but steep hike to see the trout-filled, glacially formed watery haven seemingly suspended from the side of the canyon.
Just a few hundred yards behind Hanging Lake is yet another waterfall, Spouting Rock, which jets through holes in the canyon walls."	Crystal clear lake with a shoreline of travertine located in a Colorado canyon.Â 	60657-62583 I-70Glenwood Springs, Colorado, 81601United States	39	-107	['chadlhurd', 'ellyskube', 'riknoring', 'storeyrc', 'trainingoddess', 'lcurrey56', 'coldenbu', 'pagesoftravel', 'Darwin8u', 'MagnumPI', 'brent', 'flanders', 'AAlcazar', 'simpsonamanda8', 'ajoutwest', 'leslipeterson', 'Rachel']	2012-05-09	['Ayres of Swinister', 'Cascade Falls', 'Jusanji Pond', 'Valaste Waterfall']	"[""Jessica Mendoza's 16 Watery Wonders of the Western United States"", ""Jessica's List""]"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hanging-lake-waterfall
