0	Halloween House	['Los Angeles', ' California']	414	1636	"This single family home launched Michael Myers’ murder-spree that has continued through one of the longest running horror franchises of all time.
Near West Hollywood, on a quiet street just north of Sunset Boulevard, called Orange Grove Avenue, you’ll find an unassuming house in the middle of the block that has become infamous as one of the murder houses from John Carpenter’s 1978 horror classic, Halloween. This is the house where Annie (Nancy Kyes) is babysitting. Her friend Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) was babysitting at another nearby location, 1530 North Orange Grove Avenue.
Most of the action of the film takes place at 1537. Michael’s first victim is the family dog. Then he kills Annie inside the car in the garage behind the house. Soon after, a pair of amorous friends arrive at the empty house and take the opportunity to “get busy” in an upstairs bedroom, but Michael has other plans for them. All this takes place as Laurie watches from across the street, growing increasingly suspicious, trying in vain to reach her friend by phone. The only thing to do is to walk over and investigate for herself, and we all remember how that turned out.
Today the house is still a private residence, assumedly with a great deal less murder."	Everyone remembers Laurie Strode from Halloween, but this is the house where most of the blood was shed. 	1537 Orange Grove AveLos Angeles, California, 90046United States	34	-118	[]	2016-10-31	['Thompson Home', 'A Christmas Story House and Museum', 'Sculptured House ', 'Indiana Jones Home']	"[""A Horror Buff's Great American Roadtrip""]"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/halloween-house
