0	High Point Restaurant (RyeMabee Mansion) 	['Monteagle', ' Tennessee']	109	532	"This stately three-level, Tudor style house was constructed in 1929 by Irene Mabee. It has long been believed that the home was once a pit stop for mobster Al Capone as he traveled from Miami to Chicago. The area is considered a highpoint between the two major cities. 
The interior of the home was once equipped with a rooftop escape hatch and tunnels underneath used to transport Capone’s liquor. Local folktales persist to this day about John Dillinger and Capone playing cards on the patio while enjoying a drink. 
In the early 2000’s, the mansion was refurbished and became known as the High Point Restaurant, well-known for its aged steak and fresh seafood."	This mansion turned restaurant was once a pitstop for Al Capone during his travels.  	224 Main StMonteagle, Tennessee, 37356United States	35	-85	[]	2019-08-22	['La Casa de los Azulejos', 'Restaurante La Oruga', 'The Campbell House', 'Marshall Hall']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/high-point-restaurant
