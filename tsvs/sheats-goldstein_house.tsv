0	Sheats-Goldstein House	['Beverly Hills', ' California']	42	601	"Whether its a decadent drug den or a super-villian’s eccentric lair, the Sheats-Goldstein House built into the Hollywood hills is the go-to location for films that need a one-of-a-kind background. 
Sitting on about four acres of land, the house was designed and built by John Lautner in 1963 for the Sheats family, and subsequently bought and renovated by multi-millonaire James Goldstein in 1972. In addition to its ultra-modern design, featuring luxurious built-in pieces of furniture, the floor-to-ceiling windows offer sweeping views of Los Angeles. The unique luxury and unbeatable view have made the home a perfect location for filming and has been featured in a variety of movies such as Charlie’s Angels, Pulp Fiction, and The Big Lebowski. The house has been used so many times, the unique triangular design of the ceiling leaves many viewers with a feeling of déjà vu."	An ultra-modern vista that has been featured in so many films the house is a celebrity in its own right. 	Beverly Hills, California, 90210United States	34	-118	[]	2013-11-15	"['Karen Blixen Museum', ""Laura Palmer's House"", 'Egasse-Braasch House', 'Monumental House of Emilio ""El Indio"" Fernandez']"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sheats-goldstein-house
