The beach sings its signature song as the waves come in and disturb the rocks. When the stones resettle, they tinkle like millions of little bells. It’s a soft sound, so you have to stand fairly still and be quiet to hear it.
The unusual musical concert isn’t the only thing intriguing about the beach. Even when Lake Superior is calm and the air is silent, the place still feels magical. The pink rocks, which formed from fallen pieces of a nearby rhyolite cliff, are an eye-catching sight on their own. The stones, worn and weathered by years of erosion, are all wonderfully smooth to the touch.
The beach is also one of the three scientific and natural areas along the lake. It was named after Iona Lind, who owned the resort that once stood on the spot where the beach’s parking area now is."	When waves crash onto this section of beach, the rocks sing a song.  	Minnesota, 55616United States	47	-91	[]	2018-06-15	['Winnemucca Lake', 'Travelers Monument', 'Chapel Rock', 'Silver Lake Sand Dunes']	['18 Beautiful Beaches That Have Secrets']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ionas-beach
