It is a tribute to the many East Germans who travelled to the West German embassy in Prague to seek asylum in 1989. Those to whom it was granted had to leave their Trabbys behind as they fled to the west.
This sculpture made its first appearance in 1991 in the city’s old town square. Today it is a permanent fixture in the garden of Prague’s Federal German Republic Embassy."
