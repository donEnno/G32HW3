0	The Super Museum	['Metropolis', ' Illinois']	623	588	"It’s Superman! It’s a museum! It’s a museum about Superman!
And it’s in Illinois.
Metropolis, Illinois, to be exact, which really rounds out the experience for Superman fanatics. And fanatics are exactly what this museum tries to attract, with the comprehensive (if there is such a thing) and Superman-centric lore, memorabilia, and history that fills the building from wall to wall.
The Super Museum opened in 1993, and features the collection of Jim Hambrick. There are over 20,000 items of superman memorabilia, including the only remaining George Reeves costume. An iconic, and much photographed giant Superman statue is just outside the store.
Metropolis, Illinois also hosts an annual Superman festival each June.  There are events and activities for all ages.  Of course, Superman is there, and various stars associated with the movies and television series have been known to visit."	You have to love a museum with a truly dedicated focus. A focus on Superman, for example. 	517 Market StreetMetropolis, Illinois, 62960United States	37	-88	['Josh', 'Belcher', 'charollinger', 'winddancer424', 'calvinsehrt', 'emilywilkerson14', 'alisam9', 'blake', 'west', 'renkessler']	2012-01-16	['The Wax Museum', 'Camera Museum', 'Papaya Studio ', 'The Noguchi Museum']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/super-museum-metropolis
