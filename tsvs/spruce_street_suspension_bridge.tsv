This charming bridge is inconspicuous, but truly special.
Located in the residential Bankers Hill neighborhood, the Spruce Street Suspension Bridge is supported by cables embedded in massive concrete slabs beneath the soil. Walking over the long bridge isn’t for those with a fear of heights—the bridge literally suspends over the canyon, and a sharp wind gust can make it swing slightly.
Build in 1912, and engineered by Edwin Capps, this footbridge was initially designed to provide pedestrians a passage across the deep canyon, to get between the new trolley lines built on Fourth and Fifth avenue. It now serves as a secret, serene, and very romantic spot, beloved by locals and visitors to San Diego alike.
