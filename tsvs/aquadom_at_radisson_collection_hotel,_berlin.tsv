0	AquaDom at Radisson Collection Hotel, Berlin	['Berlin', ' Germany']	852	2000	"Touted as the largest cylindrical fish tank in the world — 25 meters high and 12 meters in diameter — the Aquadom is a sight to behold.
It contains over one million liters of water, a coral reef, and is home to nearly 2,600 fish from 56 different species.
A tank of this caliber cannot be simply viewed from the ground, and with the luxury and style the Radisson Collection hotels pride themselves in, they’ve solved this problem in a grand way. An elevator takes guests up through the inside of the tank for a full 360-degree view of the fish as well as the divers who care for them and the tank on a daily basis.
The AquaDom was built by the Union Investment Real Estate GmbH at a cost of 13 million euros for the aquarium alone. Biological management lies with the Berlin Society for Large Aquariums.
The AquaDom is maintained by Sea Life Berlin, which is located right next to the hotel. Visitors to both the hotel and Sea Life Berlin can take a breathtaking ride in this one-of-a-kind sea life habitat."	The largest free standing aquarium in the world resides in a hotel lobby in Berlin. 	Karl-Liebknecht-Strasse 3Berlin, 10178Germany	52	13	['giuliafab', 'Johan', 'SWE', 'snowjunkie21', 'Elconejodeldiablo', 'reley250', 'Luis', 'Morato', 'DaytonDUI', 'Rachel', 'Seth', 'Teicher']	2012-03-04	['Montaña Mágica Lodge', 'Dog Bark Park Inn', 'Camino Real Sumiya', 'Hotel del Coronado']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/aquadom-at-radisson-blu-berlin
