0	Giant Needle and Button	['Manhattan', ' New York']	1679	657	"Walking down 7th avenue in Manhattan’s fashion district, you might be surprised to see a massive button and needle leaning against the Fashion District Information Center. While the sculpture was designed in the style of works by Claes Oldenburg, it was designed and built along with the information center by Pentagram Architectural Services.
Just next to the information booth, a statue of a garment worker toils in the shadow of the huge needle and button. This weathered-looking bronze statue is a work by Judith Weller. It depicts her father, one of a great many Jewish immigrants who moved to New York and wound up working in the garment district. Looming over the immigrant worker, the needle and button feel less whimsical and more menacingly oppressive."	There must be a pun in this haystack somewhere... 	39th Street and 7th AvenueNew York, New York, 10018United States	40	-73	['Helen', 'Rose', 'Cheap', 'clothing', 'MAGNETs', 'SEANETTA', 'Leslie', 'McIntyre', 'renkessler']	2012-02-28	"[""'Mullum Mullum the Owl'"", 'Josie Lyon Statue and Grave', 'Lyhdynkantajat (The Lantern Bearers)', 'Scioto Lounge Deer Sculptures']"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/giant-needle-and-button
