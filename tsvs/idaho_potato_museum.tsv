0	Idaho Potato Museum	['Blackfoot', ' Idaho']	340	790	"This museum highlights the agricultural and commercial history of potatoes. It features a giant potato sculpture and also serves as the home of the world’s largest potato chip, a 25-inches long Pringle dating from 1991. 
Lay’s slogan “betcha can’t eat just one” is exemplified in this local museum filled wall-to-wall in potato paraphernalia. From the moment you step through the door (adjacent to a several-foot-long baked potato with a permanent tripod to commemorate your trip) and pay the entry fee (and receive a potato sack with a box of hash browns), you are inundated with starchy goodness.
The museum offers information and entertainment for all ages, with examples of products, a build-your-own Mr. Potato Head Station, and animatronic potato people. The gift shop offers an array of cheesy potato-themed products to take home, such as shirts with Da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man replaced with a potato.
Connected to the museum is a cafe serving potato products and ice cream."	This museum glorifies the humble potato. 	130 Northwest Main Street Blackfoot, Idaho, 83221United States	43	-112	['evilgreentriangle', 'noblekeyser', 'Klara', 'Collector', 'of', 'Experiences', 'OliviaRose', 'notoriousFIG', 'glucomaniac', 'Molly', 'McBride', 'Jacobson', 'dacubsrule']	2011-12-13	['Canadian Potato Museum', 'Baked Bean Museum of Excellence', 'National Cookie Cutter Historical Museum', 'World’s Oldest Edible Ham']	"[""The Ultimate Guide to the World's Food Museums"", '10 Places That Will Take You to Potato Paradise', 'The Ultimate List of Wonderfully Specific Museums']"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/idaho-potato-museum
