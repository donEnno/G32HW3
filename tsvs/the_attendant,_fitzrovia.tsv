0	The Attendant, Fitzrovia	['London', ' England']	186	732	"These ornate, underground urinals once served the Victorian gentlemen of London. Now they serve diners espresso, flat whites, and amazing breakfast. Walk down the stairs to take your seat at one of the full size, porcelain urinals and sip your coffee among the most elite, historical toilets in Fitzrovia.
Originally built in the 1890s, these public toilets were closed in the 1960s. They sat boarded up for over 50 years before being reimagined as an upscale coffee bar."	Drink your espresso at a Victorian-era urinal in this underground-restroom-turned-coffee-bar. 	27A Foley StLondon, England, W1W 6DYUnited Kingdom	51	0	['willfaulkner', 'Snowdrop68', 'reley250', 'wgreen8', 'SEANETTA', 'uguu']	2019-07-23	"['The Loovre', 'Café in the Crypt', 'Café Strauss', ""Freeport McDonald's""]"	['25 Coffee Shops to Visit Before You Die']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-attendant-fitzrovia
