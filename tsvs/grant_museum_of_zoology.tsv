0	Grant Museum of Zoology	['London', ' England']	678	2218	"With over 67,000 specimens, the Grant Museum of Zoology is the last of the university zoological museums in all of London.
Along with its examples of extinct animals, like the bones of a Dodo and the bones and skins of a Quagga and Tasmanian Tiger, the museum houses numerous jarred specimens and skeletons. Here you may see jars crammed full of moles or bats, bisected chimpanzee and sea lion heads, kangaroo and manatee fetuses, pickled tree shrews, lion skeletons, and Tapir skulls.   
There are specimens from Robert Grant himself, along with Thomas Henry Huxley, bisected heads from the collection of Sir Victor Negus, and glass models made in the 1800s by the Blaschka family.
In 2013, the Grant Museum opened the Micrarium in a formerly unused office space. It’s a backlit cavern of microscopic and lantern slides celebrating the tiniest creatures in the world."	The only university zoological museum in London houses extinct animals, bizarre natural history specimens, and a Micrarium of microscopic creatures. 	University College LondonGower StreetLondon, England, WC1EUnited Kingdom	51	0	['standeruijteruk', 'Snowdrop68', 'ylva', 'Monsieur', 'Mictlan', 'SEANETTA', 'krazikupo', 'wurzeltod', 'exeternaen', 'espartaco', 'Annetta', 'Black']	2013-02-22	['Museum fur Naturkunde', 'Royal Museum for Central Africa Natural History Collections', 'Powell-Cotton Dioramas', 'Natural History Museum of London']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/grant-museum-of-zoology
