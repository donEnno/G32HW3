This is roadside America at its kitschy best. It would spoil the fun to know ahead of time what The Thing is, but suffice to say the museum features some antique Americana at its best.
Don’t worry about finding “The Thing?” There are scores of billboards pointing the way. You really CAN’T miss it. There is a very small admission charge and plenty of free parking."
