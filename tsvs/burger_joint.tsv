0	Burger Joint	['Manhattan', ' New York']	721	1230	"There’s an element of daring to eating at Burger Joint. Pull back the curtains in the Parker Meridien Hotel, and a delicious surprise awaits. Actually, a number of delicious surprises await, all under the umbrella of Burger Joint, a secretive fast food eatery in the hotel lobby.
Given the nature of finding the restaurant, it’s relatively simple inside. The menu is tiny and without gimmick, bringing the restaurant back to the root of all eateries, good taste. Although we tend to forget this principle for novelty in New York, there isn’t much better than biting into a tasty burger and washing it down with a shake."	Slyly buy a shake in the Parker Meridien lobby. 	119 West 56th Street New York, New York, 10019United States	40	-73	['aniaru', 'cait7911', 'valnobia', 'icatsstaci', 'beasanpedro', 'davidbiggs']	2012-02-25	['Elliott Street Deli & Pub', 'The Consulate', 'Tai Tung', 'Tsaghkunk Restaurant']	['Even Midtown Manhattan Has Its Secrets']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/burger-joint
