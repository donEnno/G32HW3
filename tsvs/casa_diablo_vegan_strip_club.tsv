Casa Diablo was originally a vegan family restaurant named Pirates Tavern, but had little appeal to workers in northwest Portland, who preferred some action with their arugula. So Johnny Diablo, the restaurant’s owner, decided to rebrand Pirates Tavern into something less conventional.
Aside from serving vegan food, the club prohibits its dancers from wearing fur, feathers, leather, or wool while performing. The establishment has been criticized and even sued by people claiming it trades the exploitation of animals for the exploitation of women."	Is this the most Portland place ever? 	Casa Diablo Vegan Strip ClubPortland, OregonUnited States	45	-122	[]	2017-06-19	"['Tai Tung', 'Tsaghkunk Restaurant', ""Sally Lunn's"", 'Criollito']"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/vegan-strip-club
