There’s a lot of history behind this rock and its alien landscape, but just know that it’s well worth the drive—roughly 30 minutes from downtown Atlanta.	Like Mars, but much closer. 	3350 Klondike RdLithonia, GeorgiaUnited States	33	-84	[]	2019-05-07	['Qurnat As Sawda', 'Yangykala Canyon', 'Neptuni Åkrar', 'Wadi Rum']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/arabia-mountain
