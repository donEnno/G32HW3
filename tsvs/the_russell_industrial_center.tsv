0	The Russell Industrial Center	['Detroit', ' Michigan']	318	619	"Built between 1915 and 1925, the Russell Industrial Center was designed by Albert Kahn and, with seven buildings spread across a massive campus, is an imposing structure. It has a long and varied history, but the Russell currently stands as a home for dozens of artists of all styles and techniques, providing space in which they can develop, produce, and sell their work.
Architects, clothing designers, glass blowers, wood craftsmen, graphic designers, painters, and metal sculptors—artists of these types and more all call the Russell Industrial Center home, helping the Russell to rapidly become the largest art and small business mecca in the entire Midwest. The Russell Center offers affordable space—sometimes for as little as $3 per square foot—but it also offers the artists that work there the opportunity for networking with others in their field.
The People’s Arts Festival is an annual event coordinated by the Russell Center. The Center works with film producers, photographs, and many others to make the event—and the several art exhibitions that comprise it—a success. This is only one of the many events put on by the Center."	Enormous small-business mecca in the Midwest, serving dozens of artists. 	1600 Clay St.Detroit, Michigan, 48211United States	42	-83	[]	2010-10-09	['The Japanese-Style\xa0House of Prospect Park South', 'Herz-Jesu-Kirche', 'Castillo Pittamiglio', 'Murtoa Stick Shed']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-russell-industrial-center-detroit-michigan
