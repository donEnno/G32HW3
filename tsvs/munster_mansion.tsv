0	Munster Mansion	['Waxahachie', ' Texas']	236	1453	"Many people loved the ’60s TV show “The Munsters,” but few loved them as much as Charles and Sandra McKee.
Charles and Sandra McKee have spent the last nine or so years turning their Victorian home into a nearly perfect replica of the famous ’60s sitcom Munster mansion. However instead of being located in the fictional ‘Mockingbird Heights,’ this house was built in Waxahachie, Texas.
Since a blueprint to the Munster family home never existed, the McKees watched all 70 episodes of the show in order to create their own floor-plan. Luckily for them, not every room in the house was shown, allowing for a few personal non-Munster rooms. Every room featured in the TV show is present in the new incarnation, even the coffin shaped phone booth. The very first sight when entering the mansion is the large oak staircase which housed the Munsters’ fire-breathing pet. Amazingly, the stairs even lift up to reveal said incendiary friend.
Currently the house is only available for touring during October and its annual Halloween charity fund raising event, but costs nothing to see. There are plans to open the house up for more frequent tours in the future. Cast members of the original show often attend the fundraisers; Al Lewis (Grandpa), Butch Patrick (Eddie), and Pat Priest (Marilyn) have all been guests of 1313 Mockingbird Lane.
Appearing almost exactly as the set house did on television, the only difference is that this Texan version appears newer. The ultimate goal of the McKees, however, is for the house to look just as it did in the show. The exterior is to be painted darker, aged, and distressed in order to achieve the decayed look of the original Munster Mansion. With a little more age and dust, the two homes should be nearly indistinguishable."	A Victorian mansion, painstakingly reproduced to appear just as the the Munster's family home did on TV. 	F.M 8131313 Mockingbird LaneWaxahachie, Texas, 75165United States	32	-96	[]	2010-01-18	['Rosenheim Mansion', 'Pioneertown', 'Carey Mansion', 'Portmeirion Village']	"[""A Horror Buff's Great American Roadtrip""]"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/munster-mansion
