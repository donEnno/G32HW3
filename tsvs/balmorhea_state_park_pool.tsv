With strikingly clear water, a depth of up to 25 feet and a temperature of 72-76 degrees, it is ideal for both swimming and scuba diving. A consistent churn of over 22 million gallons of water a day flows through the pool, meaning it needs no chlorination. The popular stop at Balmorhea State Park was part of the New Deal, FDR’s Depression-era plan to create jobs. The CCC operated from 1933 to 1942, creating manual labor for unskilled, unemployed men and preserving and developing the country’s natural resources."	A spring-fed pool so deep it's used for scuba diving as well as swimming. 	Balmorhea, Texas, 79718United States	30	-103	[]	2013-07-29	['Pasco County Stilt Houses', 'Anclote Key Lighthouse', 'Cycling Through Water', 'Liebian International Building']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/balmorhea-state-park-pool
