Wearing from wind and water carved the harder igneous rock and created pools and slides along the east fork of the Black River. This area is known to many as nature’s waterpark. You start from a shallow river and slide between boulders into the pools below.
Underground springs even provide cool water on hot days. High river levels can provide an added level of danger as the likelihood of being pulled under increases dramatically. In addition, some of the pools can be very deep and may be concealing underwater ledges and caves."	Erosion and time have created a naturally-formed water park. 	Taum Sauk TrailLesterville, Missouri, 63654United States	37	-90	[]	2013-07-19	"['Murchison Falls', ""Thor's Well"", ""Horsetail Fall's Firefall"", 'Cascade Falls']"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/johnson-s-shut-ins
