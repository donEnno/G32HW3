0	The Bay Model	['Sausalito', ' California']	315	542	"Housed in an unassuming low-slung building on Sausalito’s waterfront, the Bay Model was built by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1956-57 to demonstrate what would happen if the South Bay were dammed and infilled (as had been proposed). 
Using simulated tidal action the Corps were able to prove that the results would be disastrous for the bay environment, and the plan was shelved. The model is still owned and maintained by the Corps inside the Bay Model Visitor Center and is still in good shape. Water flows through the delta, into the bay, and out through the miniature Golden Gate. At over 1.5 acres, it’s an enormous contraption, and you can wander around the whole thing (though no swimming is permitted!). 
In addition to the model, there are exhibits on the history of Bay Area watercraft, the Marin Shipyard, World War II generally, and the modern working life of the bay."	A working model of the entire San Francisco Bay and much of the Sacramento River Delta, complete with regular tides that change every 14 minutes. 	2100 BridgewaySausalito, California, 94965United States	37	-122	[]	2013-05-01	['Amsterdam Ordnance Datum', 'Nilometer', 'Washington Mini Monument', 'Sweden Solar System']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bay-model
