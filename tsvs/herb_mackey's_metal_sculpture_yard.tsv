These creatures from every corner of your imagination fill his yards and adorn his stone walls. In a wonderful example of recycling and reuse, Mackey creates his metal minions from found objects.
Regulars to Salem, even when not taking the ferry, will walk the extra bit to see what new things have been born of Mackey’s mind. Mackey considers this his hobby, and others would call it art.
Some of the statues have price tags on them, so you can purchase his creations by putting money into his mail slot and taking home your chosen piece."	One man’s hobby is another man’s world of metal wonders. 	10 Blaney StreetSalem, Massachusetts, 01970United States	42	-70	[]	2012-07-27	['Callejon de Hamel', 'Casa Neverlandia', 'Le Moulin Jaune', 'El Nido de Quetzalcóatl']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/herb-mackey-s-metal-sculpture-yard
