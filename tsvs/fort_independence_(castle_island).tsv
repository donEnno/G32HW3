0	Fort Independence (Castle Island)	['Boston', ' Massachusetts']	746	610	"This piece of land was once an island; locals still refer to the site of Fort Independence as Castle Island, its original name. Edgar Allan Poe once graced these grounds during his first years of service for the U.S. Army.
The water around the fort has since been filled in, but it’s been used as the grounds for military operations since the early years of America’s history. The first fort here was built in 1634; the current Fort Independence was built somewhere between 1834 and 1851.
Edgar Allan Poe served at Castle Island in 1827. It is said he may have based his short story, “The Cask of Amontillado,” on a tale about a duel between two officers at the Fort."	On a former island, this old fortification once used to protect the Boston Area and started Edgar Allan Poe in his military career. 	Fort IndependenceBoston, Massachusetts, 02127United States	42	-71	[]	2011-08-23	"['Grave of Daniel ""Mad Dog"" Morgan', 'Captain Thunderbolt Statue', ""Buckley's Cave"", 'Falks Grav']"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fort-independence
