0	Underwater Hotel in Key Largo	['Key Largo', ' Florida']	163	1581	"Not far from the scuba diving haven of John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park in Key Largo, Florida, you can find a different way to scan the serenity of underwater life while staying warm and dry.
At Jules’ Undersea Lodge, aptly named after Jules Verne, you have to put on a scuba suit just to get to your bedroom, which incidentally is located at the bottom of the sea. For those whose minds immediately jump to any number of films featuring nightmarish underwater hellscapes while trapped thousands of feet below the surface, not to worry - Jules’ is only two fathoms down. For anyone trying to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life, the constant ruckus of construction work and the wailing of sirens in the middle of the night, going to the ocean floor might literally be the most guaranteed escape from the madding crowd you’ll ever find.
Once in your lovely abode, you’ll notice it’s a bit more like sleeping in a resting submarine from the 1970’s than a full-service hotel, but for the adventurous among us that sort of eerie isolation could be just what the doctor ordered."	Stay in a room with a view... of the bottom of the ocean. 	51 Shoreland DriveKey Largo, Florida, 33037United States	25	-80	[]	2016-07-19	['The Mermaid Inn', 'Pre-Hispanic Mine of Taxco', 'The Jail in the Gunter Hotel', 'Sala Silver Mine Hotel Suite']	['The Best of Weird Florida', 'Mermaids I Want to Meet']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/underwater-hotel-in-key-largo
