0	Haus Schwarzenberg Street Art Alley	['Berlin', ' Germany']	927	1977	"On the north side of Berlin’s famous Hackescher Markt stands the entrance to the Hackeschen Höfe, a series of interconnected art nouveau courtyards featuring shopping, entertainment, and dining. Just a bit farther up the street, however, another courtyard is hidden away all on its own. Lacking a grand entryway, it can be easy to miss, but through its humble portal lies a hot spot of Berlin street art.
Since street art is mercurial and chaotic by its very nature, the art on display in the alley next to Haus Schwarzenberg changes on an almost weekly basis, with new pieces being painted on, papered over, added to, and repurposed in the constantly evolving collage that washes over this little urban oasis. Famous street artists like El Bocho, Miss Van, Stinkfish, Otto Schade, and more have been known to add to the churn. The alley also features a famous painting of Anne Frank by Jimmy C that remains intact and untouched.
The existence of this vibrant cultural pocket is thanks chiefly to Haus Schwarzenberg, a non-profit arts organization that occupies the building adjoining the alley. Even more artwork can be found in the stairwells and shops located in the building, so be sure to have a peek inside the doors leading off of the courtyard while you’re there."	A narrow passage next to a cafe leads to a courtyard exploding with murals, tags, and paste-ups. 	Rosenthaler Straße 39Berlin, 10178Germany	52	13	['Johan', 'SWE', 'antoniomanuelmelo', 'mawdsleyem', 'derWaliser', 'Osage', 'Chiaraq', 'reley250', 'Blindcolour', 'SEANETTA', 'RHyzer']	2017-05-12	"['Aldeia Artística (Artistic Village)', 'Clydeside Expressway Mural Wall', 'Barrio de Guadalupe Street Art', ""'Highway'""]"	['25 Places Reborn Through Graffiti and Street Art']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/haus-schwarzenberg-street-art-alley
