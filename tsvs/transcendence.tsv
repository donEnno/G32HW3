0	Transcendence 	['Portland', ' Oregon']	876	987	"The whimsical statue depicting a salmon swimming through the corner of a building parallels the lighthearted, eccentric reputation of Portland itself. 
Made by Oregonian sculptor Keith Jellum, the hand-forged bronze fish measures 11 feet in length. It was placed in a very fitting location on a seafood restaurant on Salmon Street.
The absurdity of an oversized metal salmon crashing through the brickwork of a popular restaurant is not lost on those who notice it, though its location on the 3rd floor of the building means that it is often overlooked by passersby."
