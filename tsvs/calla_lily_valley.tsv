0	Calla Lily Valley	['Carmel-By-The-Sea', ' California']	107	544	"If you’re traveling along Highway 1, this is the ideal place for a scenic hike or a relaxing respite from a day of traveling. 
Not far from Gate 19 in Garrapata State Park (near mile marker 63), is a small, almost hidden gate inviting visitors to venture through. From there, it’s a small hike through patches of wildflowers until you come face-t0-face with a beautiful little valley, complete with a creek that flows into the ocean.
Follow the Garrapata Trail toward a bluff overlooking the beach. Then follow a few wooden steps toward the creek and down into the valley. If you time your trip correctly and arrive during the late winter or early spring, the small valley will be filled with thousands of blooming white calla lilies."	This little valley along Highway 1 is engulfed by thousands of lilies during the spring season.  	Garrapata TrailCarmel-By-The-Sea, California, 93923United States	36	-121	[]	2019-11-16	['Mazama Queen Mine', 'Jam Up Cave', 'Paper Airplane Trail ', 'Scala del Paradiso']	['18 Places Where You Just Have to Stop and Smell the Flowers']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/calla-lily-valley
