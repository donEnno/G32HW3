0	Minichelista Restaurant	['Mexico City', ' Mexico']	87	685	"Minichelista in Mexico City is likely the most bizarre restaurant you will ever visit, and even one of the best. Created 10 years ago by artists, the space is full of little tiny nooks and crannies where you can eat at a table made from the handlebars of a motorcycle as you sit in a closet with your date.
The restaurant is a large house, and as you walk around the residence and up spiral staircases it feels like the place is your own as food is being cooked all around the house. The staff are super casual, drinking coffee from cups as they wait your table and smoking cigarettes while greeting you at the front door.
Everything is well thought-out at this amazing establishment. Even the french fries that come with your meal will arrive on the plate as a collection of a few thin fries, a few wedges, a couple of happy faces, and some rippled fries: Someone actually takes the time to mix up the fries for the plates. The milkshakes will melt your mind once they hit your tongue. A hot chocolate comes with cayenne to make sure it warms everything up. The quirkiness of this place is surely worth mentioning to anyone visiting the city."	A quirky and charming restaurant founded by artists. 	197 GuanabanaMexico CityMexico	19	-99	[]	2016-12-16	['Restaurante La Oruga', 'The Consulate', 'Tai Tung', 'Tsaghkunk Restaurant']	['Marine Biologist Melissa Cristina Márquez’s 12 Spots for Cultural Immersion']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/minichelista-restaurant
