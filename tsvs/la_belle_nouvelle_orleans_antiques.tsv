0	La Belle Nouvelle Orleans Antiques	['New Orleans', ' Louisiana']	181	1002	"A city with such a rich and fabled history as New Orleans is bound to be home to its share of antique artifacts and curio shops. Occupying a dim storefront on Magazine Street, La Belle Nouvelle Orleans Antiques may be the strangest of them all. 
Peering into the shop’s double windows, visitors glimpse an array of eccentric historical debris: Religious relics, antique medical equipment, portraits of jazz singers, and old secret society paraphernalia all make their home among larger salvaged architectural pieces and industrial fixtures. This is just the kind of place you would expect to find in New Orleans. For those travelers seeking the dark, mysterious, and strange aspects of the city, Owner Fernando Promoslovsky doesn’t disappoint. The only thing that sets this apart from the best local museum is that you can take the history home with you.
Promoslovsky is a third-generation antiquarian and dealer, hailing from Buenos Aires where his family began their business. When he established LBNO Antiques 18 years ago, its items were primarily sourced from Argentina and Europe. For the past two decades, he has refined his offerings to entice a more eccentric collector. Victorian mourning jewelry, old anatomical charts, prosthetic limbs, magic lantern slides are just a few of the dusty gems to be discovered in this treasure trove of local and international artifacts."	This unique shop is full of memento mori art, antique medical equipment, secret society paraphernalia, and historical relics. 	2108 Magazine StNew Orleans, LouisianaUnited States	29	-90	[]	2019-07-19	"['Bar Farm Antiques', 'The Hidden South Confessional', ""Frank Miranda's Oddities & Antiques"", 'Shaddow Domain']"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/la-belle-nouvelle-orleans-antiques
