0	Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum	['Weston', ' West Virginia']	516	1883	"The Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum, which changed names over the years and was known as the Weston State Hospital later in life—operated from 1864 to 1994. 
Today it stands as a testimony to the inhumane practices once used in mental health. Sitting on 26.5 acres, this spooky area is home to numerous buildings, including a museum, a gift shop where a few of the remaining employees still work, and an abandoned cemetery.
Famous for its looming structure, it was built using the Kirkbride design, a design common to asylums of the early 19th century. Much of the asylum remains closed off to the general public as the main building and out-buildings are in bad repair and are structurally unsound. A wide choice of tours are available, and specialty supernatural/ghost hunts, even overnighters are available for those searching for tortured spirits who have yet to escape."	A particularly creepy abandoned hospital that sparks interest for lovers of the supernatural. 	50 S River AveWeston, West Virginia, 26452United States	39	-80	['sharonrose979', 'ryanvollmer', 'jolennox', 'catbri42', 'rbt45769', 'paigeelizabeth3660', 'quietdream', 'Destination', 'aficionado', 'dawhirly', 'allyflame', 'DigitalSorceress', 'renott', 'rugby007', 'Molly', 'McBride', 'Jacobson', 'tekkbabe859', 'Afjsdoiuqnnn', 'vew5674', 'Rachel']	2013-05-08	['Riverview Hospital', 'Valerian Wall at Niche Hotel', 'Klafthmonos Square Parking Structure Fortification Walls', 'Ex-Monastery of Santiago Apóstol']	['Unusual Wedding Venues', '18 Abandoned Psychiatric Hospitals, and Why They Were Left Behind']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/transallegheny-lunatic-asylum
