Zoo is no exception. While the landscape is covered with strange succulents and clumps of Mexican sage, there is something much more exotic planted here, with a much more interesting history.
Away from the expected California wildflowers and blowing grasses, there is a secret garden of rescued plants, ancient gymnosperms called cycads. Kidnapped by poachers from their native homes and smuggled in by nefarious plant dealers, this rare, palm-like specimen dates back to the Permian Period. 280 million years in existence, cycads (which exist in as three families in most warmer parts of the world) can live for a thousand years, and fetch a pretty penny on the black market. A two-year investigation led to an international sting that reclaimed nearly 1,000 cycads, 94 of which were acquired and are now cared for by the L.A. Zoo horticulturist."	The L.A. Zoo has a secret garden of rare bootleg cycads, a palm specimen dating back 280 million years.Â 	5333 Zoo DriveLos Angeles, California, 90027United States	34	-118	[]	2012-02-29	['State Darwin Museum', 'Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area', 'Wood Buffalo National Park ', 'Raton Iridium Layer']	['9 Places to Get Outside in Los Angeles']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/los-angeles-zoo-botanical-gardens
