0	Modica Way	['Cambridge', ' Massachusetts']	576	732	"Richard B. “Rico” Modica Way is a public walkway in Central Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, connecting City Parking Lot 5 to Massachusetts Avenue.
Partially covered by a colorful plastic “stained glass” canopy, Modica Way is also an open-air, 24-hour art gallery. One side features a black and white photo collage of people and places around Central Square, installed by the city. The other has been set aside for use by graffiti and street artists, and is constantly updated with fantastic, colorful paintings both large and small.
A favorite stop for photographers with its ever-changing landscape, the walkway has shown work from nationally known artists Shepard Fairey and Enzo & Nio, and it’s not uncommon to find local artists at work when you visit."	An alley way dedicated to graffiti and street art is a constantly changing street gallery. 	565 Massachusetts AveCambridge, Massachusetts, 02139United States	42	-71	['bostoncoffeegirl', 'panavatar', 'Blindcolour', 'polynomial', 'neonmountains', 'hana', 'Rachel']	2013-03-19	"['Leuven Mini City', '34th Street Graffiti Wall', ""Artist's Lane"", 'Sunshine Lane']"	['17 Alleyways with Hidden Histories']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/modica-way
