0	Pizzeria San Marco	['Amsterdam', ' Netherlands']	173	768	"If you find yourself on a motorboat, puttering down Amsterdam’s tree-lined Amstelkanaal, houseboats, rowboats, and tourist cruises sloshing about alongside one another, follow your nose to the smell of freshly risen pizza dough as you steer toward the canal bridge. Mosey up to the tall window of Pizzeria San Marco, and drop anchor for a uniquely enjoyable slice of pizza, prepared as you relax amidships with a beer.
San Marco is housed within a brown-hued former watchtower on the canal bridge. But its main draw is the pizza window, located on the water, where boats can haul up and place orders. It isn’t unusual on a sunny afternoon to see a hungry boatman guardedly balancing on the bow to clamber up to the window and holler for a Margherita.
San Marco’s menu mirrors that of the average neighborhood pizza place. There’s an assortment of pizzas, pastas, salads and antipasti, and a sparse beverage list with sodas, beer, and one option each for white and red wine.
Enjoy a slice in view of the flowerbeds adorning the nearby bridge, as cyclists jingle along, and tourists and pedestrians linger on to marvel at the magnificent Amstel River. Take in the mellow ripple of an oar splashing into the water, as the symphony of a vibrant city plays above. It all adds up to a rather memorable way to enjoy a pizza pie."	Sail in for a ’dam good slice. 	Amstelkade 148aAmsterdam, 1078AWNetherlands	52	4	[]	2019-12-18	"[""McMonagle's"", 'Pizza Pi', 'Pizza Pacaya', 'Big Chute Marine Railway']"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pizzeria-san-marco
