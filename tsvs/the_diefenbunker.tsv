0	The Diefenbunker	['Ottawa', ' Ontario']	343	606	"When one thinks of Canada, they rarely think of nuclear annihilation, but the Canucks were ready for one.
The Diefenbunker was built in the late 50s to protect the Canadian Government from nuclear attack and nicknamed after John Diefenbaker who was the Prime Minister at the time. The Diefenbunker was in operation for 33 years before it was turned into a museum in 1998, and opened to the public.
The Diefenbunker has also been used as a movie set and all through the summer, cold war related movies are shown in the Diefenbunker. A highlight among the exhibitions is “Lost Nuke: The World’s First Broken Arrow is the story of the first ‘lost’ nuclear weapon, featuring artifacts from the site of the infamous plane crash.”"	Canada's subterranean Cold War museum has doubled as a movie set.  	3911 Carp RoadOttawa, Ontario, K0A 1L0Canada	45	-76	['bsempowski', 'KieferU', 'cb24602', 'Max', 'Cortesi', 'SamR', 'raffyblay', 'jhamburger', 'mbison', 'ack', 'sed']	2010-05-20	['Stalag Luft III Prisoner Camp Museum', 'Guardian Telephone Exchange Tunnels', 'FBI Spy House', 'Berliner Unterwelten (Subterranean Berlin)']	['23 Places to Relive the Cold War']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-diefenbunker-ottawa-ontario
