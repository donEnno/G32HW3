This self-explanatory monument stands 19½ feet tall and was at one time the largest chair in America. The chair was originally made out of wood but after years being battered by the elements the monument became unstable and had to be deconstructed for repairs. Instead of replacing the wooden structure the chair was rebuilt with aluminum so that the over-sized furniture would last for future generations to enjoy. The chair also garnered further local fame shortly after its construction when artist Lynn Arnold lived atop the chair for 42 days without coming down. It must be comfortable."	A super-sized promotional trick that is now a DC landmark. 	Martin Luther King Avenue and V Street, S.EWashington, District of Columbia, 20020United States	38	-76	[]	2012-08-28	"['Uniroyal Gal', ""'World's Largest Killer Bee'"", 'Paisano Pete', 'Bund Sightseeing Tunnel']"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-big-chair-washington-dc
