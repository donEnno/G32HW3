0	Belfry Oddities	['Seattle', ' Washington']	222	1056	"This incredible store in Seattle’s Pioneer Square is stocked with Victorian-era mourning pieces, antique curio, plants, jewelry, vintage taxidermy, and human and animal bones. The vibe is part speciality store, part natural history museum.
The store points out that the taxidermy is ethically sourced — a way of giving praise to an animal that would no longer be alive.  The collection is always huge, impressive, and well worth checking out."	A Seattle oddities shop brimming with Victorian-era gems and antique curio. 	309a 3rd Ave SSeattle, Washington, 98104United States	47	-122	[]	2016-02-28	['The Insect Asylum ', 'Hand of Man Museum', 'Shaddow Domain', 'Norwich Castle Museum ']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-belfry-oddities-seattle-washington
