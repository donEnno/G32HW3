Along with fellow country musicians Cowboy Copas, Hawkshaw Hawkins, and Randy Hughes, Cline perished en route to Nashville after recently having described feeling a sense of impending doom. The site, located deep in the middle of the woods, is now marked with a cement plateau which culminates in an installed boulder with the names of the crash victims etched into the top. There is also a small gazebo with an informational collage about the singer. What the site lacks in grandeur it makes up for in an atmosphere of quiet reflection."	An engraved boulder marks the spot where Patsy Cline's life ended in a plane crash. 	Mount Carmel RoadCamden, Tennessee, 38320United States	36	-88	[]	2013-09-11	"[""Joseph Kraus's Grave"", 'Mount Pleasant Cemetery', 'Tomb of William Jeffreys', 'Mausoleum of José Alfredo Jiménez']"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/patsy-cline-crash-site-memorial
