0	Quigley's Castle	['Eureka Springs', ' Arkansas']	248	888	"Known as “The Ozarks’ Strangest Dwelling,” Quigley’s Castle is more of an odd stone house than a castle. Ms. Quigley demolished the original house that she and her husband were living in while her husband was away so that he would have to help her build this strange new dwelling. The ploy seems to have worked.
Perhaps the best feature of the house is that trees grow on the inside of the large glass windows. The house is completely covered in, as well as filled with, many of Mrs. Quigley’s rock and bottle sculptures."
