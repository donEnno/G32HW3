0	Majestic Bay Theatre	['Seattle', ' Washington']	585	836	"The Majestic Bay Theatre blends the elegance of a vintage film house with the accoutrements of a modern cinema. 
The theatre is built on the site of the old ‘Majestic,’ a silent film theatre founded in 1914. In 1929, the nickelodeon was renamed the ‘Roxy’ and showed some of the country’s finest ‘talkies,’ film shorts that featured the first synchronized sound. The theatre was once again renamed the ‘Majestic Bay’ and continued showing films until 1997.
The Majestic Bay Theatre is furnished with retro ornamentation, reminiscent of its classic theatre decorations; bright neon lights welcome moviegoers to an old-style box office; a beautiful waterfall curtain rises to begin the show; nautical adornment reflects the Pacific Northwest and Seattle’s maritime culture.Though it no longer shows the ‘talkies’ of yesteryear, the Majestic Bay Theatre immerses the moviegoer in a timeless ambiance."	Continuing a tradition of movie magic on the site of America’s oldest continually operating movie theatre. 	2044 Northwest Market StreetSeattle, Washington, 98107United States	47	-122	[]	2012-09-05	"[""'Empire'"", 'Finger Lakes Drive-In', 'Hollywood Theatre', 'VisArt Video']"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/majestic-bay-theatre
