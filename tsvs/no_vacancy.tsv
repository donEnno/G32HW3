0	No Vacancy	['Los Angeles', ' California']	485	2699	"Down a back alley off Hollywood Boulevard, past the old-fashioned hotel entryway beneath a flickering ‘No Vacancy’ sign and up an eerie staircase, three doors await you in a lushly decorated hallway—behind one of them lies the secret entrance to Hollywood’s most spectacular speakeasy-style cocktail bar. 
Inside, you’ll find antique bookshelves, tightrope walkers, fire-breathing dancers, live music, handmade cigars, a photo booth inside a phone booth, a variety of hidden corners and staircases, and the best cocktails in town, in true speakeasy style.
Arrive early if you’re not on the list, dress to impress, and best of luck getting in."	A prohibition-style speakeasy takes up residence in the last Victorian residence in Hollywood. 	1701-1729 North Hudson AvenueLos Angeles, California, 90028United States	34	-118	[]	2012-02-01	['PS Air Bar', 'The Owl Bar', 'Fiume', 'Patent Pending']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/no-vacancy
