This building is now a fine dining restaurant, but has held onto much of its history. There are odd bathrooms, an empty elevator shaft made of glass, and basement access to view dolls leftover from the factory."	A former store turned restaurant with a few quirky additions.  	40 N 1st StPhoenix, Arizona, 85004United States	33	-112	['LilyLillyLillie', 'itsnogame1984', 'latinagypsy2000', 'ccesare', 'Anonymous22', 'kaitlyn3889']	2019-07-14	['Restaurante La Oruga', 'Equitable Cooperative Building Association', 'Wortley Hall', 'The Consulate']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hannys
