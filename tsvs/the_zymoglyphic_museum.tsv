0	The Zymoglyphic Museum	['Portland', ' Oregon']	219	1982	"The Zymoglyphic Museum houses the cabinet of curiosities created by artist Jim Stewart. It was formerly located in San Mateo, California, but has now moved to Portland, Oregon.
Early modern cabinets of curiosity were often divided into the categories of artificialia and naturalia, giving equal precedence to the marvels of man and God. In the dreamscape dioramas of the Zymoglyphic Museum, these two categories collide. In Stewart’s surreal tableaus, built from natural materials and installed in old aquarium tanks, it is often difficult to tell where the hand of nature stops and that of the artist begins."	Private collection of art inspired by cabinets of curiosity. 	6225 SE Alder St.Portland, Oregon, 97215United States	45	-122	['pierredemery', 'babeo', 'medhere', 'jimgstewart', 'Martin', 'zymoglyphic1', 'bethanyherron', 'Rachel', 'Nicholas', 'Jackson', 'mbison', 'wythe', 'Annetta', 'Black', 'zymoglyphic']	2013-06-13	['Ilana Goor Museum ', 'Milwaukee Art Museum', 'The American Visionary Art Museum', 'The Museum of Jurassic Technology']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/zymoglyphic-museum
