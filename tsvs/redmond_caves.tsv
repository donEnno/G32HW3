Located in the city of Redmond, OR, the caves were once a single lava tube that partially collapsed, fed from the Newberry Caldera. Now, five caves exist and are open to exploration. The caves are also much larger than they first appear. Openings are low enough that you may need to duck, but there is plenty of room to stand and walk around once inside."	A sprawling cave network created by a lone lava tube.  	SE Airport WayRedmond, Oregon, 97756United States	44	-121	[]	2019-08-01	['Margate Caves', 'Caves of Monte Castillo', 'Abukuma-do Caves', 'Wine Cellars of Cricova']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/redmond-caves
