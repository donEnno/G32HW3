0	Tunnel Number 3	['Manhattan', ' New York']	99	990	"The state of New York began digging this tunnel in 1970 to provide water to the city from its upstate source.
When completed, the tunnel will be over 60 miles long, snaking across the city from Yonkers across Central Park, the East River and Roosevelt Island and ending up in Astoria, Queens. The construction project costed over $6 billion and was not finished until 2020. The costs for the ambitious project have already been high with 23 workers losing their lives to the tunnel, averaging about one life each mile."	"Deep under Manhattan is the largest construction project in city history. So far, the project has taken the lives of 23 workers, or ""a man a mile.""Â "	New York, New York, 10007United States	40	-74	[]	2013-04-04	['Doai Train Station', 'Free Expression Tunnel', 'Tunnels of Claudius', 'La Mina de Daroca']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/tunnel-number-3
