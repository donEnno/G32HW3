The store is packed with a macabre medley of taxidermy and preserved specimens. There’s a whole assortment of human remains for sale, like skulls, shrunken heads, preserved brains, and mummy hands. 
There’s also a menagerie of exotic animal remains, including some vintage taxidermy, as well as prehistoric dinosaur fossils, and ritualist artifacts like necromancer’s masks and cannibal trophies. (The shop points out that all the objects are legally and ethically collected.) The shop space is shared with a large education center called the Prehistoria Museum. 
Update as of March 2022 The storefront has reopened post-Covid lockdowns."	A collection of human remains, animal body parts, and other macabre curiosities all legally for sale. 	397 Dundas St EToronto, Ontario, M5A 2A7Canada	43	-79	[]	2017-12-21	"[""Cranfield's Curiosity Cabinet"", 'Natural Selection', 'Studio Payne Art Gallery and Oddities Shop', ""Frank Miranda's Oddities & Antiques""]"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/skullstore-oddity-shop
