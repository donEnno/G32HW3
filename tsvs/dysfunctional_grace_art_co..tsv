0	Dysfunctional Grace Art Co.	['Tampa', ' Florida']	370	1484	"Somewhere between taxidermy and art with a heavy dose of oddity, Dysfunctional Grace Art Co. is worth the exploration. 
Things you can actually buy: beaver fetuses, mounted “jackalopes,” caskets, and a Minock Appli-caster Castration tool. Professor Diablo’s Mystical Monkey Paw Machine dispenses cursed antique jewelry and access to secret, banned books online. The shop’s wares encompass both natural and unnatural oddities, from rare mushroom coral to baby dolls in coffins. It doesn’t get much weirder than this."	An oddities shop that dabbles in the deathly and beautiful. 	1905 E 7th AveTampa, Florida, 33605United States	27	-82	['blimpcaptain', 'dysfunctionalgrace', 'markbolding', 'kangerang', 'Molly', 'McBride', 'Jacobson', 'yellowlabrat']	2016-05-29	['Shaddow Domain', 'Twelve Vultures', 'Dark Matter Oddities & Artisan Collective', 'Tennants Auction House']	['The Best of Weird Florida']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/dysfunctional-grace-art-co
