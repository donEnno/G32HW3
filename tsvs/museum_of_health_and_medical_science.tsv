0	Museum of Health and Medical Science	['Houston', ' Texas']	503	1026	This Houston museum features a 27’’½-foot intestine, a Texas-sized walk-through brain with memory games and a colossal walk-in eyeball that demonstrates how your eye receives and perceives images. There is also a massive replica of a human heart that beats. A particular delight is the skeleton riding a bicycle. A relative newcomer to the Houston area, the museum, which draws almost 200,000 people a year, has quickly become one of the city’s favorite destinations, especially for class trips–more than 40,000 schoolchildren visit the museum every year.
