0	Scott's View	['Scottish Borders', ' Scotland']	160	730	"This iconic view of the Scottish Borders is said to have been the favorite of the celebrated 19th century novelist and poet Sir Walter Scott.
The story goes that he paused to admire the view so often during his travels that his horses soon learned to stop at the viewpoint without command. When Scott died in 1832, his funeral procession passed the viewpoint on its way to Dryburgh Abbey (where Scott was interred), and it is said that his horses stopped out of habit, allowing their friend to have one final look at the Borders landscape he loved so dearly.
The overlook is now marked by a plinth and plaque, as well as several benches for those pilgrims traveling in Scott’s footsteps who wish to pause and absorb the definitive view of the Scottish Borders."	This picturesque view of the Scottish Borders was beloved by Sir Walter Scott. 	B6356Scottish Borders, Scotland, TD6United Kingdom	55	-2	[]	2016-07-07	['Torcello Bell Tower', 'Lu Xun Memorial Park', 'The Sandpit on Horsell Common', 'The Ancient Books of Wales']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/scotts-view
