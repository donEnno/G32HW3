Since the mid-1970s besides being a teacher, he has also been building a massive, and rather frightening, castle.
Inspired by druids and ancient Briton, Camani has filled the castle and its grounds with fire-breathing dragons, arches shaped like gaping mouths, and an eerie forest of tree-shaped sculptures. The castle even has a dungeon. The most distinctive feature of the Midlothian Castle, however, are the hundreds of screaming concrete heads that he has placed throughout the grounds, including a giant one on top of a castle tower. In the words of the artist, “Amidst the heads and disks, the solitude of the park envelopes the visitor in a peculiar silence, a silence both quieting and disquieting, penetrated only by the eerie scream of the peacock.”"	A school teacher's massive and terrifying self-built castle. 	981 Midlothian RoadR.R.#1Burk's Falls, Ontario, P0A 1C0Canada	45	-79	['ThatOnePotato', '22crusher', 'Engineerblake', 'princessrobyd', 'Blindcolour', 'ontariocacher', 'AriaTLoak', 'mcpiper', 'mbison', 'Annetta', 'Black', 'scriptedfate']	2010-05-20	"[""Cano's Castle"", 'Le Palais Idéal', 'El Nido de Quetzalcóatl', 'Smith Mansion']"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/midlothian-castle
