Across from the Nelson Algren fountain, a tiny family-owned restaurant, Podhalanka, still carries the torch, serving cheap and filling plates of specialties like pierogi, stuffed cabbage, and borscht.
The area has changed and Podhalanka now sits incongruously next to the nightclub Evil Olive, host of the city’s decadent hipster club night, “Porn & Chicken”."	Where old school Polish Chicago and young hipster Chicago live side by side. 	1549 West Division StreetChicago, Illinois, 60642United States	41	-87	[]	2010-07-25	"['Mystery Craters ', 'Marcell Experimental Forest', 'Cerro de las Campanas (Hill of Bells)', ""Guelta d'Archei ""]"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-remains-of-polish-broadway-chicago-illinois
