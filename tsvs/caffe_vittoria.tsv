The cafe displays dozens of vintage espresso machines and coffee makers, along with other types of coffee mugs and posters. They make a killer espresso, martini, or fresh cannoli. The shop opened in 1929 and has been packed with happy customers ever since - come in and test your knowledge of antique brew technology."	The oldest Italian café in Boston, this spot also serves as a veritable museum of vintage coffee ephemera. 	290 Hanover StBoston, Massachusetts, 02113United States	42	-71	[]	2010-09-14	['Curioporium', 'Dark Matter Oddities & Artisan Collective', 'The Terrorium Shop', 'ReGEN Haus']	['Try Historical Food at These 20 Culinary Timewarps', '25 Coffee Shops to Visit Before You Die', 'Travel to As Many of These Offbeat Places As You Can in 2018']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/caffe-vittoria
