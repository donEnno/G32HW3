Harry built the entire castle himself, using 2,600 sacks of cement and 32,000 quart milk cartons, for forming concrete bricks, 54,000 five-gallon buckets of dirt, and 56,000 pail-fulls of stone, he carried from the Little Miami, a nearby river. He also built a secret room into the castle that wasn’t discovered until it collapsed years after his death. The castle is filled with medieval trinkets and paraphernalia, including cake cutters in the shape of swords and a full size knight armor. There are even thrones you can sit in and pretend you’re royalty. 
In a freak accident, Harry Andrews set himself ablaze while cooking in the castle and died two weeks later. Today, the castle is still run by the “Knights of the Golden Trail,” the youth organization established by Andrews. Unsurprisingly, it is said to be haunted.
It’s not only an excellent tourist destination, people have been known to use it as a wedding venue over the years. It’s peaceful gardens and stone backdrop provide picturesque memories."
