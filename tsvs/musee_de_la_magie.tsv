0	Musee de la Magie	['Paris', ' France']	260	1701	"The Museum of Magic and Curiosity is a private collection of optical illusions, fun house mirrors, wind-up toys, and historical magic artifacts located in the Marais. Paired with the Musée des Automates, it also houses a terrific collection of over one hundred 19th and 20th-century automatons. There is, however, a dark side to the museum.
The collection is housed in the 16th-century vaulted cellar of what was once the Marquis De Sade’s house. Sade lived in the building as a young man and developed the beginnings of his notorious sexual appetite there. Today the museum’s whimsical holdings are a delightful counterpart to its sadist history, and are appropriate for adults and children alike. Every tour concludes with a magic show."	A museum of magic with a Sadist past. 	11 Rue Saint-Paul Paris, 75004France	48	2	[]	2008-11-21	['Museum of the Bizarre ', 'Buckland Museum of Witchcraft and Magick', 'Monster Kabinett', 'The Table That Could Talk To The Dead ']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/musee-de-la-magie
