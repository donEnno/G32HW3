Of course this also applies to dining, and Kenka fits the bill in a distinctly St. Marks fashion. Many of the dishes at Kenka don’t seem like traditional Japanese fare, and are a far cry from tempura and sushi. However, the exotic plates here are a perfect foreign meal for adventure-seeking appetites."
