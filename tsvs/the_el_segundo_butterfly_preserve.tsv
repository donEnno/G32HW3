Today a four-mile path surrounds the perimeter of the preserve and is an excellent place to see the ocean, watch planes take off and land at LAX, and see the remains of Surfridge and the reclaimed habitat of the El Segundo Blue Butterfly. The best time to see butterflies is during the later summer months when an estimated 125,000 butterflies now take flight within the preserve."
