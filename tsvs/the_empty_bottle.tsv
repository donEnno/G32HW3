0	The Empty Bottle	['Chicago', ' Illinois']	928	780	"Chicago is justly renowned for its music scene, and the city has boasted all manner of music venues, ranging from pleasant to intolerable, but few have managed to claim as much longevity and love since the Empty Bottle, as suggested by its odd awning slogan: “Dancing - Friendly - Dancing”.  
In the same small and ragged space since 1993, proprietor Bruce Finkelman has always focused on having a top-notch sound system, ethical treatment of employees and patrons, and supporting all manner of touring bands - from avant garde performers such as free-jazz specialist (and MacArthur “genius grant” recipient) Ken Vandermark, to future rock titans in their early days, such as the White Stripes and Interpol.
The club continues to book innovative acts, and often gives away tickets on their website."	"A beloved Chicago music venue offering cold beer and lots of “Friendly."" "	1035 N.
