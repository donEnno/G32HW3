0	Empire Garden Restaurant	['Boston', ' Massachusetts']	655	1599	"Although the name of this restaurant is ambiguous (it reads Empire on one sign and Emperor on the other), there is one thing that is certain about this hidden treasure of a Chinese restaurant: grandeur and extravagance. Built under the ornate, high ceilings of an abandoned, old-fashioned movie theater, visitors can enjoy an extensive menu of Chinese and Dim Sum delicacies, including treats such as chicken foot.
Located in Boston’s Chinatown on Washington Street, Empire Garden Dim Sum is served from 8:30am to 3pm daily. There is usually a wait between the hours of 11am to 2pm, therefore it is suggested to get there at exactly 2, where you will be seated immediately, with carts of food ready to fill your table in less than 30 seconds."	Dim sum, served in a grand old theater.  	690 Washington StBoston, Massachusetts, 02116United States	42	-71	[]	2009-10-19	['Elliott Street Deli & Pub', 'The Consulate', 'Tai Tung', 'Tsaghkunk Restaurant']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/empire-or-emperors-garden-restaurant
