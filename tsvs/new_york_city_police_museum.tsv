0	New York City Police Museum	['Manhattan', ' New York']	159	803	Since 1857, the NYPD have been keeping the city of New York safe for locals and tourists alike. It wouldn’t be until 1998 that their prestigious history would be cataloged in their own museum. The museum documents the evolution of the NYPD from the rattler wearing Dutch enforcers to today’s modern police officers. Unfortunately, due to hurricane Sandy, the museum is currently closed while it is being repaired.	Hear the tales of New York's most notorious criminals. 	100 Old SlipNew York, New York, 10005United States	40	-74	[]	2012-03-20	['The Insect Asylum ', 'Museo de Ropa Étnica de México (Mexican Ethnic Clothing Museum)', 'War Museum Askifou', 'Caballero No. 1']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/new-york-city-police-museum
