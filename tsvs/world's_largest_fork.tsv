0	World's Largest Fork	['Springfield', ' Missouri']	382	705	"This 35-foot tall, 11-ton fork stands shining in front of an office building in Springfield, Missouri, tines sticking into the ground.
The fork was once a fixture outside a restaurant at 3662 S Glenstone Ave. (now a Prima’s Mexican Grill), but when the restaurant closed down, the firm Noble & Associates relocated it outside their office. The towering eating utensil is worth a drive-by and a quick picture."
