0	The Blue Forest	['Halle', ' Belgium']	262	1487	"Visit this Belgian forest at just the right time in the spring, and you’ll feel as if you’ve stepped into a dream.
The Hallerbos—also known as the Blue Forest—is covered with millions of bluebells from late April into May. The otherworldly transformation of the 1,360-acre woods has a floral carpet brushing up against the lean beech trees as far as your eye takes you. Visitors can stroll the winding paths, and watch for rabbits and deer that wander through the green and azure woods. 
While the woods, located in the Halle municipality between Flanders and Wallonia, is not far from Brussels, it’s often overlooked by visitors. The phenomenon of “bluebell forests” is not uncommon in Europe, particularly in its oldest woods, but the Hallerbos is unique for the density and beauty of its blooms. 
While Hallerbos is mostly known for its bluebells, the forest features nature of all kinds in every season including oak, ash, pine, beech, giant sequoia and larch trees. As well as wildlife such as squirrels, foxes and almost 100 different species of birds."	Each spring, a dreamlike carpet of bluebells overtakes the forest floor. 	Halle, 1500Belgium	50	4	[]	2014-01-05	"['Dockey Wood Bluebells', 'Tambopata Research Center', ""Gourgue d'Asque"", 'Enchanted Forest']"	['18 Places Where You Just Have to Stop and Smell the Flowers', 'Favorites']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-blue-forest-halle-belgium
