0	Walker Library of The History of Human Imagination	['Stamford', ' Connecticut']	99	1302	"The gorgeous private library of Jay Scott Walker, founder of the Walker Digital research and development facility, was built in 2002 to celebrate “humanity’s intellectual and emotional adventure of discovery.”
Covering 3,600 square feet, the 50,000-volume library at Walker’s home holds a remarkable selection of rare works and objects including a 1776 copy of the Declaration of Independence and an atlas from 1669 noted for being the first to show the sun at the center of the solar system, instead of the Earth. The unusual, multi-level design with glass floors and angular staircase is said to be inspired by the works of M.C. Escher.
Walker is an inventor, entrepreneur and the curator of TEDMED. His library is, sadly, not open to the public."	An Escher-inspired library dedicated to the wonders of the human mind, yet closed to the public. 	Private ResidenceStamford, Connecticut, 06901United States	41	-73	[]	2012-12-17	['Suzzallo Library Reading Room', 'Biblioteca Palafoxiana', 'Mirzoyan Library', 'The Matenadaran']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/walker-library-of-the-history-of-human-imagination
