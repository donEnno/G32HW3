The collection was organized by St. Bart’s Victorian-era surgeon and pathologist James Paget, best known for his identification of the bone disease now known as Paget’s Disease.
The museum opened in 1879, but includes specimens that are much older.
The hospital itself was founded in 1123, and was given to the city of London in 1543. The hospital is also home to a memorial plaque to Scottish national hero William Wallace, and another to the 5,406 injured WWI soldiers who passed through the hosptal at the turn of the last century. It also served in fiction as the setting for the first meeting between Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson’s, standing in as Watson’s alma mater.
The museum is not open to the general public, but can be seen by appointment."
