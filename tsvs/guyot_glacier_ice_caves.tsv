Larger ice caves like this may be filled with stream sediment, and if the glacier melts without erasing it, the result is a long winding ridge of sand called an esker."	Gorgeous cave resemble a winter wonderland. 	Yakutat, AlaskaUnited States	60	-141	[]	2013-07-24	['Nigardsbreen Ice Cave', 'Grutas del Palacio', 'Benagil Caves ', 'Chinhoyi Caves']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/guyot-glacier-ice-caves
