0	Endor Iron Furnace	['Sanford', ' North Carolina']	128	823	"Located deep on a 426-acre nature park, the Endor Iron Furnace still retains most of the imposing nature it must have held as it spat out workable iron.
The Endor Iron Furnace is on of the more stunning pieces of North Carolina history.  The furnace itself is a 35-foot tall, stacked-stone edifice at the end of a path liberally sprinkled with the remains of iron ore and pig iron dropped in its heyday of operation during the Civil War. It was built a bit off the beaten path to take advantage of the veins of ore in the nearby Deep River. Refined iron only steamed from the Endor Iron Furnace for a cumulative total of ten years, but its remains have kept the memory of a tumultuous time alive for well over a hundred years.
Update as of August 2020: The site is currently fenced off for protection."	Ruins of an American Civil War iron forge still survive today.  	5399 Iron Furnace RdSanford, North Carolina, 27330United States	35	-79	['AlwaysKaitlyn', 'johnallisonweiss', 'clayontheroad', 'HelloKitty', 'johnpageott', 'zsapphira', 'Aimeesaurus', 'AF', 'Rachel']	2014-01-22	['Stone Edge Cupola', 'Knežev Arsenal', 'El Charco del Ingenio (The Mill Puddle)', 'Aldridge Sawmill']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/endor-iron-furnace
