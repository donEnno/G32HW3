The American Kennel Club’s Museum of the Dog features more than 700 drawings, watercolors, prints, sculptures, bronzes, and figurines. It’s a collection that’s sure to (bow-)wow you.
The museum was founded in 1982, and was originally located at the New York Life Building. In 1987, it was moved to St. Louis, where it remained for the next thirty years.
In 2019, it relocated and reopened again, this time returning to New York City. You can now visit it to see rotating exhibitions, digital interactive displays, and a 4,000-volume research library at the American Kennel Club headquarters, located in the iconic Kalikow Building
Update as of November 2019: The AKC Museum of the Dog has relocated to New York City."
