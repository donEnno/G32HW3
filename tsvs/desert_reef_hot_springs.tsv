These hot springs were inadvertently created when subsurface oil exploration led to a pool of hot water streaming from deep underground. Now home to a clothing-optional, family-friendly resort, these hot springs have fulfilled their destiny as a truly unique destination for naturists and those looking to relax and become more in tune with the Earth.	This naturally-sourced hot spring is now home to a clothing-optional resort. 	1194 Co Rd 110Florence, Colorado, 81226United States	38	-105	[]	2012-01-03	"['Pačir Geothermal Spa', ""Ma'in Hot Springs"", 'Fosso Bianco', 'Badab-e Surt']"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/desert-reef-hot-springs
