0	Eccles Dinosaur Park	['Ogden', ' Utah']	398	607	"Tucked away along the Ogden River Parkway lies the Eccles Dinosaur Park. Around one hundred dinosaur replicas fill the 8-acre park. The full-sized sculptures are based on actual fossil skeletons. One display combines robotic dinosaurs and a high tech sound system to make a “life-like” dinosaur encounter.
The park also includes entrance into the Elizabeth Dee Shaw Stewart Museum which houses the latest dinosaur finds in Utah and around the world. Full-size dinosaur skeletons tower over informative displays of actual fossils, replicas and models. The museum also includes a working paleontology lab where visitors can observe real dinosaur bones being prepared for display.
A children’s dig of a Stegosaurus skeleton along with other hands on activities are found at the Education Center."
