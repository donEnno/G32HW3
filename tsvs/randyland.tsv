Randyland is the labor of love of Pittsburgh artist Randy Gilson, a local artist and neighborhood renovator. Over the years Gilson has almost singlehandedly turned a blighted neighborhood corner in Pittsburgh’s Mexican War Streets into one of the most colorful spectacles in the city. Every square inch of his corner building is brightly painted and decorated with pink flamingos, giant banana plants, mismatched lawn furniture, mannequins, and plastic dinosaurs, among many, many other pieces of found ephemera. The space functions as a home, garden and artist’s space that Gilson shares with likeminded creators.  
After turning his home into a candy-colored anti-depressant of a structure, Gilson has spread his artistic influence to the surrounding areas of the neighborhood, seeding art and installation projects throughout a 30-block radius. He has erected hundreds of “streetscapes,” worked on establishing multiple public parks in empty lots, and contributed to a number of community gardens.  
Prior to the establishment of Randyland and its joyous influence, Pittsburgh’s Central Northside was a neighborhood in decline, but Gilson’s enthusiasm, elbow grease, and scavenger’s instincts have managed to turn the area into more wonderland and less copland."	Found art has transformed this Pittsburgh neighborhood into a psychedelic dream. 	1507 Arch StreetPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15212United States	40	-80	['jmpeters67', 'paulruta', 'weirdbug', 'iwasaround', 'hfloccari', 'joedissolvo', 'buffycaine99', 'alphasixty', 'randylandpgh', 'Martin', 'Rachel']	2013-09-02	['La Maison Sculptée ', 'Air Crash', 'The Indecent Little Man on the Church of St. James', 'Zorthian Ranch']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/randyland
