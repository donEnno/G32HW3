This area is squarely located in what is known ancestrally as Chickasaw land.  
The son of French Canadian nobles, Timothy Demonbreun disregarded his titles and took up the life of a simple fur trader in Tennessee. After finding a spot along the Cumberland that attracted a great deal of game, he chose to stay in the remote area and establish himself, but with no man-made shelter around, he holed up in a small cave. The first resident of European descent in what is now Nashville, Demonbreun used this cave as a temporary home for several months while pursuing his livelihood as a fur trader and building a more suitable residence. Later a successful merchant and tavern keeper, this “First Caucasian Citizen of Nashboro” still has many descendants in the area today.
The cave now seems like just a large crack in the rock above the Cumberland, but it is actually protected as a national landmark and the entrance is guarded by steel bars."	"The small cave that housed Tennessee's ""first citizen."" "	1700 Omohundro DrNashville, Tennessee, 37210United States	36	-86	[]	2012-07-27	['Sassi di Matera', 'El Nido de Quetzalcóatl', 'Masitise Cave House Museum', 'Quinta da Regaleira']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/timothy-demonbreun-s-cave
