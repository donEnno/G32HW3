0	World's Largest Ball of Twine	['Cawker City', ' Kansas']	421	627	"This twine ball isn’t just huge – it’s continually growing. No better way to ensure that it maintains the title of the World’s Largest, of course.
Every August, Cawker city holds the annual twine-a-thon. This is a chance to add your contribution to the world’s largest ball of twine. 
Frank Stober started the ball of twine in 1953. In Just 4 years the ball weighed 5000 lbs and stood eight feet tall.
There is not much in Cawker City but the local businesses get in the spirit with twine-themed artworks in the windows and a painted twine stripe on the sidewalk. However, driving around the area is an experience.  The neighborhood is slightly empty and eerie with odd collections in the residents’ yards and broken-down buildings everywhere. The perfect site for a horror film."	It's big, it's a ball, and it's made of twine--the world's largest of its kind. 	Cawker City, Kansas, 67430United States	39	-98	['shelleyaug6', 'alisaj1964', 'JoeBenSimo', 'Britt', 'Todd', 'AF', 'Martin', 'bd', 'Gerard', 'Nolan', 'crschmidt', 'Mark', 'Casey']	2013-03-10	"['The Grand Kugel ', 'Merchant Ball', ""World's Largest Ball of Stamps"", 'Big Bowl']"	['Favorites']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/world-s-largest-ball-of-twine
