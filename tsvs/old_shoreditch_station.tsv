0	Old Shoreditch Station 	['London', ' England']	338	679	"Old Shoreditch Station Coffee Shop is much more than just a coffee shop. The shop converts into a bar in the evenings and features a food menu, but more interestingly, it serves as a space where artists can exhibit their work and music fans can catch a gig.
The venue is sponsored by Jaguar Shoes Collective, an affiliation of businesses and individuals working toward promoting local art, including visual and musical offerings. The space also serves as a place for product line launches and is a prime spot for people watching in the bustling Shoreditch district in London’s East End."	Once a train station along the Great Eastern Railway this vibrant coffee shop and bar is where members of London’s creative class mingle. 	1 Kingsland Road London, England, E2 8AAUnited Kingdom	51	0	['arylaufer', 'mooselyn', 'SEANETTA', 'hrnick', 'Martin', 'Rachel']	2013-07-17	['Carton King Creative Park', 'Mai-Kai Restaurant', 'The Tonga Room', 'Ithaa Undersea Restaurant']	['19 Pubs Around the World Perfect for a Pint', 'The Best British Pubs to Get Drunk on History', '9 Cool Shops in London']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/old-storeditch-station
