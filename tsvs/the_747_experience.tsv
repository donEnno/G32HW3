0	The 747 Experience	['Atlanta', ' Georgia']	180	782	"Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta is one of the busiest airports in the world, serving more than 100 million passengers a year. So it’s fitting that the city is home to a jumbo-sized exhibit dedicated to the Boeing 747, so-called “Queen of the Skies.”
Very few airlines currently operate the iconic Boeing 747 aircraft, but you can still step inside one at the 747 Experience, part of the Delta Flight Museum. This exhibit lets aviation enthusiast walk inside a retired B747, visit the prestigious upper deck, and even walk outside on top of the wing. The main cabin seating has been removed to reveal the enormous interior, which now houses educational material on the aircraft’s history and legacy. 
This particular plane is ship 6301, and it was the first 747-400 built by the Boeing Aircraft Company in 1988. It flew more than 61 million miles before making its final voyage from Honolulu to Atlanta in September of 2015. The craft was renovated to serve as a museum exhibit, and opened in March 2017. The museum and aircraft are now parked adjacent to the world headquarters and offices of Delta Air Lines."
