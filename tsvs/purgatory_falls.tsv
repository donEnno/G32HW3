Despite the lovely natural surroundings, legend has it that the Devil himself once invited a number of churchmen to a bean feast at the falls, and while cooking in a pot heated directly by the fires of Hell, Ol’ Scratch drew too much heat and melted the rock around his foot which got him stuck. Evidence of this infernal meal still remains. Among the upper falls there is a large hole in the rock called “The Devil’s Bean Pot” and nearby is another indent in the stone referred to as “The Devil’s Footprint.” Despite the possibility of evil dinner parties, the scenic area used to be a tourist spot from the 1890s until the Great Depression. Remains of the hotels and visiting areas can be seen around the upper and lower falls."	Beautiful natural falls where Satan once ruined a pot of beans. 	Lyndeborough, New Hampshire, 03082United States	42	-71	[]	2012-09-01	['Cascade Falls', 'Valaste Waterfall', 'Njupeskärs Vattenfall ', 'Kalambo Falls']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/purgatory-falls
