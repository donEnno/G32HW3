The experimental design was soon hyped as the home of the future, but only less than 100 were ever built, and around 60 still remain scattered across the globe. This Futuro now houses the Pensacola Beach Preservation and Historical Society Headquarters."	Pensacola's UFO home has withstood many hurricanes—just as the experimental 1960s design intended. 	1304 Panferio DrPensacola Beach, FloridaUnited States	30	-87	[]	2016-09-16	['Polychrome Historic District', 'Stone Mansion', 'John Burroughs Woodchuck Lodge', 'Olander Banks Sr. and Margaret Lomax Banks Community Park']	['The Best of Weird Florida']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pensacola-futuro-house
