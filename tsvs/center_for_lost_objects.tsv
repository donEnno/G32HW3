Items like jewelry, upcycled and antique furniture, and even a taxidermy squirrel carrying a pitchfork with a head speared on top fill its collection of unusual finds.
The center specializes in unique collectibles and oddball items. It’s a haven for makers and DIY enthusiasts. It holds classes on how to upcycle furniture and hosts pop-up shops that feature pieces from various artists, makers, and collectors.
The Center for Lost Objects also hosts monthly live figure drawing sessions, where the model poses in different tableaus made up of the pieces in the store, such as the furniture, candelabras, and bear skin rugs. One model even rode a full mount deer.
The large front window doubles as a stage for experimental performances and music. There’s also studio space in its basement for musicians."	An unusual assortment of art, furniture, and other curiosities. 	957 7th St WSaint Paul, MinnesotaUnited States	44	-93	[]	2017-08-10	"['Studio Payne Art Gallery and Oddities Shop', ""Creepy's "", 'Novis Mortem Collective', ""Cranfield's Curiosity Cabinet""]"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/center-for-lost-objects
