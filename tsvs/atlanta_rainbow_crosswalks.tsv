The rainbow crosswalks were installed in 2017. The city’s mayor announced plans to give the streets their colorful stripes in June of 2017 to mark the one-year anniversary of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida. It’s a bright, colorful way to commemorate a dark day in America’s history.
Temporary rainbow crosswalks first appeared in 2015 during Atlanta’s pride festivities, but they were erased within weeks. More than 20,000 people signed a petition created by activist Sarah Rose to make them a permanent fixture. Two years later, their wishes came true.
The colorful memorial is meant as a symbol of unity and acceptance. It both honors the tragedy of the Pulse shooting and playfully marks the Piedmont area as the hub for Atlanta’s LGBTQ culture."
