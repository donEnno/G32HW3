0	Devil's Swimming Pool 	['Victoria Falls', ' Zambia']	196	711	"When the water running off of Victoria Falls is at a certain level, a small pool with almost no current forms which adventurous tourists have dubbed the Devil’s Swimming pool.
Formed by a rock barrier at the edge of the falls, the water hole welcomes any daring swimmer the opportunity to wade right up to the edge of the falls themselves. However a small amount of deaths have occurred when people are swept over the edge.
The pool is accessible during the hot dry season (usually between September and November, when the water level is at its lowest)."	The world's highest and most dangerous infinity pool lies at the precipice of Victoria Falls. 	Victoria FallsZambia	-17	25	['superbetsy', 'natasha1', 'chovanec523', 'brian7992', 'Leslie', 'McIntyre', 'Seth', 'Teicher']	2015-12-29	['Yuncheng Salt Lake', 'Pertosa Caves', 'Waw an Namus', 'Lake Posta Fibreno']	['Favorites']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/devil-s-swimming-pool
