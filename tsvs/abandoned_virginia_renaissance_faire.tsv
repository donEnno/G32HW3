0	Abandoned Virginia Renaissance Faire 	['Fredericksburg', ' Virginia']	323	2912	"Open only in its Fredericksburg location from 1996 to 1999, the Virginia Renaissance Faire attempted to create a replica medieval square where dads could be bards and bards wouldn’t be laughed at, but today all that remains are the tick-infested, moldering husks of those bygone fantasies.
Built to create an immersive atmosphere, the Virginia Renaissance Faire attempted to create the illusion of a bustling feudal port. Multiple buildings were erected in the style of medieval European architecture with towers and improbable buildings on stilts. There was even a replica sailing ship sitting in the small pond on the lot, where performers would put on various entertainments.
Unfortunately, after just two seasons of waning profits, the faire shuttered its gates and abandoned the regal site as it stood. Many of the decorations and props were moved to a similar operation in Wisconsin, but the structure was simply left in place to rot.
Today the Virginia Renaissance Faire’s spirit has been carried on by a separate event with the same name, but the old locations still stand, slowly being overgrown and falling apart. Adventurous explorers have rediscovered the hidden ruins a number of times over the years reporting more decay, graffiti, and even paintball damage. Recently a drone pilot recorded a scenic flyover of the site. It must be noted that the abandoned buildings sit on private property that is also frequented by hunters so visiting is prohibited. Not even full plate mail can stop bullets and trespassing tickets."	The remains of a failed attempt at medieval nerdery are hidden deep in the woods of Virginia. 	1175 Kings HwyFredericksburg, Virginia, 22405United States	38	-77	['lorenzo1811', 'Katecrimson', 'backwoodsbushcraftnbourbon', 'steve', '66784054', 'gdfgdg', 'nachoha', 'dc2az1', 'acar87', 'dc1904', 'ashleighstorm010', 'Mark', 'Loftin', 'DKWinters', 'JamesR', 'valerieonll70', 'jones11', 'Martin']	2014-09-08	['Godstow Abbey Ruins', 'Rindoon', 'Hore Abbey', 'Craswall Priory']	['The United States of Abandoned Places', '33 Deserted Places Around the World', 'Abandoned DC Metro Places to Photograph']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/abandoned-virginia-renaissance-faire
