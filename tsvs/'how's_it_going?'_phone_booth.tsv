But no calls go in or out. The lonesome phone booth is a sculpture created by Icelandic artist Guðjón Ketilsson in 2006, the centennial of the first international telegraph cable in Iceland. Reaching from Scotland to Iceland, the underwater connection began Iceland’s telecommunications with the rest of the world.
Inside the booth, you can see a small plaque, overgrown with moss and weeds, that reads,“Hvernig gengur?” The words translate to “How’s it going?” in English."	An isolated, rusty phone booth commemorates Iceland's first international telegraph cable. 	Hafnargata RoadSeydisfjordurIceland	65	-13	[]	2018-05-17	['Quantum Cloud', 'Torso in Metal from Rock Drill', 'Ye Olde Hurdy Gurdy Museum of Vintage Radio', 'Dolmen de Dalí']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/hows-it-going-phone-booth
