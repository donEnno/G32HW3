0	Thistle Ghost Town	['Fairview', ' Utah']	372	1036	"The town of Thistle, Utah, was established in 1883. It flourished for a time as a farming and ranching community and became a major stop on the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad.
Then, in April of 1983, a massive landslide, the costliest in U.S. history, dammed two creeks, flooding and destroying most of the tiny town. Roofs became rafts and can still be seen strewn about the area. Only a few structures remain, and most can be seen from the road, including a red schoolhouse, a house on a hill (which has recently been demolished), and a half-sunken house into a bog, and the old train machine shop.
In August 2018, a large fire burned through Spanish Fork Canyon after a lightning storm. More than 30,000 acres of land were destroyed, including many of the remaining structures in Thistle."
