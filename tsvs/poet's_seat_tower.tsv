The scenic observation spot actually earned the name “Poet’s Seat” in the mid-1800s when local writer Frederick Goddard Tuckerman coined the phrase. As the highest point in the city, the spot commands some truly panoramic sights. To make even more of the incredible view, a wooden observation tower was built on the edge of the lookout in 1879. This crude construction stood on the site until 1912 when the current stone turret was built on the site. The tower has multiple floors that visitors can access via winding internal staircases. The tower’s series of arched windows allow for the best possible view of Greenfield spread out below.
While it does not seem to have been discovered or appropriated by LARP enthusiasts, the Poet’s Seat Tower continues to look ready to defend Greenfield from Dark Age invaders, but it is more likely to see stinging verse fired from it parapets than flaming arrows."	This tall Massachusetts folly got its name thanks to all of the purple prose its vistas inspired. 	Mountain RoadGreenfield, Massachusetts, 01301United States	42	-72	['Hubertyanita', 'TheKopasClan', 'Gavin', 'ghostfilm', 'TokenEskimo', 'Emily', 'Dudek', 'e1savage', 'Martin']	2015-01-12	['Wainhouse Tower', 'Anza Borrego Desert View Tower', 'Vandalian Tower', 'Hellemann Tower and City Walls']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/poet-s-seat-tower
