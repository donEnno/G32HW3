Virtually invisible unless deliberately sought out, Atlantis Books is a tiny bookstore packed with some of the greatest literary works by authors such as Leo Tolstoy and Samuel Beckett.
Opened in 2004 by a group of young and adventurous college students, the shop offers a plethora of books from international authors translated into English. A small set of stairs framed by vines funnels visitors past a vibrant mural and into the bookstore.
The store is a winding maze of books, all sorted by genre. You’ll find anything from literary classics to intriguing newer titles. Splashed along white walls are quotes and colorful illustrations that swirl around the entire bookstore. There’s also a timeline of the bookstore’s creation running along one wall.
Chairs and tables are tucked into the nooks and crannies of the area, inviting readers to sit down and get lost within the pages of a book. Don’t be surprised if you spot a cat or two snoozing among the stacks. Above ground, the bookstore boasts a patio offering a stunning view of the sparkling sea."
