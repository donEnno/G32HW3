0	Wreck of the S.S. Atlantus	['Cape May', ' New Jersey']	650	528	At Sunset Beach in Cape May, NJ, you can see the remains of the S.S. Atlantus sticking out the Delaware Bay. The ship was one of a few experimental ships made of concrete that were built during World War I. It has been slowly receding into the bay since it snapped loose during a storm and ran aground in 1926. It has been receding into the bay ever since.	The rusting remains are visible sticking out of the waters of the Delaware Bay. 	Cape May, New Jersey, 08204United States	38	-74	['ken', '82e38a4e', 'HollyandRich', 'Occhiogrosso18', 'Gerard', 'Nolan', 'Rachel', 'Annetta', 'Black']	2013-05-07	['La Famille Express Wreck', 'SS Maheno', 'SS Sapona', 'City of Salisbury Shipwreck']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/s-s-atlantus
