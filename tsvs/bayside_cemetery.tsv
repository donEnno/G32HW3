Now an urban forest encloses one section of the cemetery and other parts are neglected, with vandalism has been a serious problem in recent decades, including the desecration of remains and destruction of mausoleums. However, volunteers are working to preserve and restore the historic cemetery, which has a quiet, rural beauty in the shadow of the rumbling A train tracks, where foliage flourishes and lizards crawl over the solemn tombstones. 
Update as of April 2020: The cemetery is currently closed to visitors.
Update as of March 2021: The cemetery is open to visitors on Sundays from 9 am-3 pm,  but closed on all Jewish Holidays.  However, the cemetery can be viewed clearly and photographed by walking around its perimeter on Pitkin Ave."	One of the oldest Jewish cemeteries in the city, it is now overgrown with an urban forest. 	80-35 Pitkin AvenueQueens, New York, 11417United States	40	-73	[]	2013-03-15	['Nagcarlan Underground Cemetery', 'Crypt of Dr. William Edward Minahan', 'Warstone Lane Cemetery Catacombs', 'Grave of W.
