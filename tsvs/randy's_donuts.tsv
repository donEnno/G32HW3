Just beyond an off-ramp of the I-405, a giant donut (32.5’ in diameter) stands proudly atop the roof of the otherwise modest building, serving as a beacon for donut lovers everywhere. Randy’s has made cameos in dozens of films, including Iron Man 2, and, indeed, its fame has certainly spread. The combination of Randy’s Donuts’ simple drive-through layout and mouthwatering treats has cars lining up down the block at all hours."	A giant donut stands as a popular symbol of Los Angeles iconography. 	805 West Manchester BoulevardInglewood, California, 90301United States	33	-118	['DannyBoy', 'ccesare', 'Mike', 'F', 'Findingbalance18', 'jowensamuels95', 'notoriousFIG', 'Martin', 'Avoiding', 'Regret', 'Rachel']	2012-07-21	"['5 de Mayo Food Market', 'Carton King Creative Park', ""Trader Vic's"", 'Mai-Kai Restaurant']"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/randy-s-donuts
