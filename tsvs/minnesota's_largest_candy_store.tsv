0	Minnesota's Largest Candy Store	['Jordan', ' Minnesota']	500	747	"Across the highway from Jim’s Apple Farm in southern Minnesota’s Scott County is a sprawling bright yellow retail store. The golden dome at one end can be seen from miles up the road like a sunrise on the horizon. 
This seasonal, family-owned business has been operating here nearly 40 years. From mid-May to November, visitors can find local, regional, and imported sweets and treats of all kinds: candied fruits, chocolate bars, fresh baked goods, frozen items, gummies, jelly beans, sodas of every flavor (including Moxie, Cheerwine, and Faygo’s Rock N’ Rye), and even a few toys.
While you shop, you can also admire the ceilings painted in a wild, whimsical dreamscape of food and pop culture impressions. Don’t forget to read the oversized billboard on the way out of the gravel parking lot: It’s usually posted with some quippy pun or sarcastic reflection on the times."	This bright yellow building is packed with sweet treats from all around the world, from chocolate-covered crickets to whoopie pies. 	20430 Johnson Memorial DrJordan, MinnesotaUnited States	44	-93	[]	2018-08-08	"['Shane Confectionery', 'Soap Plant / Wacko', ""Cranfield's Curiosity Cabinet"", 'Tamr Hena Museum']"	['Trek for Treats to 11 of the World’s Most Unique Candy Stores']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/minnesotas-largest-candy-store
