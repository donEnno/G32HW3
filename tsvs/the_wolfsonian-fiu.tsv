Included in the collection are works in glass, ceramics and metal, rare books, periodicals, ephemera, works on paper, paintings, textiles, and metals.
Several countries are represented here, most notably Germany, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, the United States, Austria, Czechoslovakia, France, Hungary, Japan, and the former Soviet Union. Some popular collections are: the British Arts & Crafts movement, Dutch and Italian versions of the Art Nouveau style, American industrial design, objects and publications from world fairs, propaganda from WWI and WWII and the Spanish Civil War, New Deal graphic and decorative arts, avant-garde book design, and publications and design drawings relating to architecture.
The museum was opened to the public in 1995, and has received recognition from scholars, collectors, educators, the media and visitors for its showcase of art and design as both an agent and indicator of societal and cultural change. It also supports scholarship and develops critically acclaimed exhibitions, publications, and educational programs that highlight the impact of design on the modern world."
