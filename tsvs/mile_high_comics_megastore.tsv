0	Mile High Comics Megastore	['Denver', ' Colorado']	303	891	"Created by Chuck Rozanski, this gigantic warehouse is a pop culture, media, and of course, comic book paradise. Inside, around 45,000 square feet are filled with nearly 10 million comics, as well as toys and other memorabilia. It’s believed to be the largest comic book store in the country.
Rozanski began collecting comics in the 1960s and never lost the passion as he got older. During the 1980s, he was one of the first people to advertise back-issues of comics for sale in the back of Marvel Comics. That business would eventually become a very lucrative one, allowing Rozanski to purchase the warehouse. Colorado also presents the perfect climate for comic book storage.
Items inside this mega store can range from $1 to well over $20,000. Mile High Comics also hosts various events such as conventions and even drag shows, it’s a very diverse space. Upstairs is the true hidden gem of the store, Rozanski created a small exhibit dedicated to his collection of Native American art."	While comics are the main attraction at this megastore, the second floor plays host to an exhibit fit for a museum.  	4600 Jason StDenver, Colorado, 11211United States	39	-104	[]	2020-01-17	['Best Video Film & Cultural Center', 'The Grundhauser Hero Lending Library', 'Red Planet Books & Comics', 'Novis Mortem Collective']	['15 Quirky Places to Visit on Your Next Colorado Family Road Trip']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/mile-high-comics-megastore
