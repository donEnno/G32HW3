0	Heald Square Monument's Statue of Liberty	['Chicago', ' Illinois']	278	701	"The Heald Square Monument is a Chicago landmark, an 11-foot tall bronze sculpture by Larado Taft showing General George Washington standing between the two principal financiers of the American Revolution, Robert Morris and Haym Salomon.
What makes this beautiful sculpture particularly interesting is the little-known bronze plaque on the back side of the granite base, showing a seated Statue of Liberty. In this depiction, Lady Liberty is “stretching out her arms to welcome all persons of whatever race and belief.”"	The iconic Chicago sculpture hides a beautiful and easily overlooked plaque on the backside.  	34 E Wacker DrChicago, Illinois, 60601United States	41	-87	[]	2017-01-23	['Lyhdynkantajat (The Lantern Bearers)', 'The Fourth Plinth', 'Madame Chapeau Sculpture', 'Schöner Náci']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/heald-square-monument
