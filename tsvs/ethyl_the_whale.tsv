0	Ethyl the Whale	['Santa Fe', ' New Mexico']	271	1210	"Ethyl the Whale is an  82-foot-long, life-sized sculpture of a blue whale that holds the Guinness world record for largest recycled plastic sculpture. It was created by two artists from San Francisco, Yustina Salnikova and Joel Stockdill, to bring awareness to the negative impact plastics have on the environment, and was named after its polyethylene body. 
Ethyl was originally built for the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California. It was subsequently acquired by the Santa Fe-based art collective Meow Wolf in 2019 and then dramatically transported to the New Mexico desert.
You can walk all around Ethyl to explore the enormous work of art, and also enjoy it illuminated at night."
