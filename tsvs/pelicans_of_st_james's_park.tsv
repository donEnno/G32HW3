The colony of disturbingly large, but friendly, birds include five Eastern Whites and one South American White. Pelicans were first introduced to the park in 1664,  a generous gift from a Russian Ambassador. In 2013, three of the five Eastern Whites arrived as a gift from the city of Prague, joining the descendants of the original Russian flock.
The pelicans can regularly be seen basking on rocks between 2:30 and 3:00 daily, when they are fed fish by the park rangers, when they aren’t sneaking into the London Zoo to pilfer the fish of their less free-range friends. The pelicans are extremely social, and quite used to human companionship — it’s not unusual for them to leave their lake to sit on the benches alongside bemused office workers and tourists."	Giant, friendly pelicans in Central London, the most unlikely of places. 	3 Birdcage WalkLondon, England, SW1A 2HQUnited Kingdom	51	0	['beefjorky', 'Snowdrop68', 'davenorth93', 'katielou106', 'Monsieur', 'Mictlan', 'Gavin', 'jschrlmr', 'hrnick', 'Rachel']	2013-09-24	['Woods Bay State Park', 'Udawalawe National Park', 'Vratna Gates', 'Marine Park Salt Marsh']	['When Animals Are Not Where You’d Expect Them to Be']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pelicans-of-st-james-s-park
