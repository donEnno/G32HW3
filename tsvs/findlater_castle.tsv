The name of the castle is believed to come from the Gaelic fionn leitir, which means “white cliff” referring to the quartz in the rock. The structure that remains today dates from a 14th century reconstruction after the castle had been taken over by Viking invaders. The dovecot nearby has been dated to the 16th or 17th centuries."	These ruins are a hidden gem, complete with fantastic views over the cliff edge. 	Findlater CastleBarnyard of FindlaterPortsoy, Scotland, AB45 2UDUnited Kingdom	57	-2	[]	2019-04-03	['Hume Castle', 'Arshi Castle', 'Duffus Castle', 'Eger Castle Replica Ruins']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/findlater-castle
