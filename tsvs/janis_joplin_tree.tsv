The hill has enjoyed its reputation for mellow lounging and music dating to the city’s epic age of the Hippie. One observer of 1960s San Francisco culture noted, “To this hill streamed the endless river of young persons drawn to San Francisco in search of personal freedom, in search of peace in time of war, or possibly just in search of Acapulco Gold, incredibly good marijuana that wholesaled at $65 a kilo.”"	A famous alternative culture epicenter and where Joplin serenaded young hippies. 	Hippie HillGolden Gate ParkSan Francisco, California, 94122United States	37	-122	[]	2010-09-07	"['Toronto Music Garden', 'The Music Tree', ""'Stand By Me' Tree"", 'The Singing Trees']"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/janis-joplin-tree
