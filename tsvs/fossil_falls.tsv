Exploring Fossil Falls is a great way to explore ancient history that still exists in our day and age.  Volcanic flow nearly 20,000 years ago left fields of volcanic rock in what is now the Inyo desert. When glaciers from the Sierra Nevada Mountain range melted after the last ice age they formed rivers and lakes of runoff.  As this runoff eroded the basaltic volcanic rock, the rounded, unnatural forms were created. The rock formations are smooth, twisted and black and descend into steep cliffs remembering the power of the ancient rushing waters. 
Fossil Falls is an excellent and unique example of the earth’s geologic memory as basaltic rock formations are not common and these are staggeringly impressive."	Smooth basaltic rocks tell a tale of ancient glacial waterfalls. 	Inyo, CaliforniaUnited States	35	-117	['mikenstein', 'Spinach', 'FrugePhoto', 'Keri', 'Kilgo', 'Thomas', 'Martin', 'Avoiding', 'Regret', 'Rachel']	2013-09-11	['Slumgullion Earthflow', 'Looking Glass Rock', 'Sasso Menicante (Trembling Stone)', 'Macquarie Island']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fossil-falls
