Varying widely in shapes and sizes, many of the different puppets in the museum’s collection represent fairytale figures such as devils, dragons or princes.
In addition to rotating their collection of puppets at least annually, the Puppentheater-Museum holds readings and workshops for both children and adults and puts on shows with the puppets in a small theater space. Tour guides at the museum put together special tours depending on the age and size of visiting groups."
