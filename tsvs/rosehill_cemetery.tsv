Rosehill is home to beautiful monuments and several ghost stories, although none is more terrifying than the real life clown that was spotted in the cemetery at night by a passerby and caught on video.
Rosehill is a quintessential Victorian cemetery with underlying themes of Victorian iconography: the draped urns, the obelisks, the arches. Unlike its neighboring cemetery, Graceland, Rosehill’s monuments are a bit more subdued. 
Several Chicago mayors and other notables including Richard Sears, the founder of Sears Roebuck & Co., Aaron Montgomery Ward, the founder of Montgomery Ward & Co., and John G. Shedd, the founder of the Shedd aquarium are entombed here. Rosehill is also home to a large Civil War memorial and Firefighter’s memorial."	Chicago's largest cemetery is full of beautiful Victorian monuments and more than a few ghost stories. 	5800 N Ravenswood AveChicago, IllinoisUnited States	41	-87	[]	2016-11-17	"['Zemun Fortress', 'Nagcarlan Underground Cemetery', 'Grave of Walter ""Snowy"" Farr', 'Yanakie Station Cemetery']"	['Unique Cemeteries in Chicago']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/rosehill-cemetery
