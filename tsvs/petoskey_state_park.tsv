Now, Petoskey State Park on the shore of Lake Michigan holds some of the only reminders that the Midwestern state was once an ocean. When Earth’s tectonic plates shifted and created the North American Continent out of this watery ecosystem, some of the coral life residing there came along for the ride.
The state park is named for Petoskey Stones. These are small, unremarkable rocks, only identifiable by the faint spots covering their surface. When polished though, the perfectly hexagonal pattern grows visible, revealing what they really are. These are no ordinary pebbles; they’re actually the skeletons of prehistoric coral. Each of the spots was once a coral polyp. The dark centers were mouths, and the “rays” surrounding them were tentacles. Time has scrubbed them down to a rounded rock, but combing the beach for these little fossils can offer even amateurs a connection to the very, very distant past."	A popular place to pick up prehistoric coral fossils from the time when Michigan was an ocean. 	2475 M-119 HighwayHarbor Springs, MichiganUnited States	45	-84	[]	2016-10-19	['Hemer Felsenmeer', 'Crystal World Exhibition Centre', 'Mississippi Petrified Forest', 'Mineral Wells Fossil Park']	['The Most Wondrous State Parks to Visit During the Government Shutdown']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/petoskey-state-park
