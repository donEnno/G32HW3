But in the back of one Rockville charity shop, these mundane items aren’t for sale—they’re museum pieces.
The back walls of the Wagging Tails Thrift Store are consumed by the Museum of Outdated Technology (“MOOT”). Though the “artifacts” are mostly indistinguishable from the other obsolete technologies for sale in the shop, these dusty old electronics are being saved for posterity. Though vinyl and slide projectors are the kind of thing you would find stashed and forgotten in your parents’ basement, here at the museum they are preserved with care.
As silly as it may seem, there will come a day when your old DVDs will be genuinely rare objects. If you don’t care to save them yourself, consider donating them to the Museum of Outdated Technology to impress the retro kids of the future."	The shelves in the back of this thrift store are devoted to saving, not selling, retro tech. 	1300 E Gude DrRockville, MarylandUnited States	39	-77	[]	2017-03-03	['National Telephone Kiosk Collection', 'Dimitrie Leonida Technical Museum', 'Computer Museum of America', 'Endicott History and Heritage Center ']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-of-outdated-technology
