Originally installed by Adolph Sutro in 1887, it has become a strange relic: deprecated and inaccurate. To start with, it’s not the geographical center of San Francisco – though, prior to bay-fill it was probably a lot closer.
The statue “The Triumph of Light” was a copy of a Belgian statue depicting the triumph of Lady Liberty over Despotism. and the hill itself was known as Mount Olympus. However as time went on this “Goddess of Liberty” was forgotten, vandalized and by the 1940’s was literally crumbling away.
Today, the statue itself is gone, what remained of it – torsos and legs mostly – having mysteriously vanished in the 50’s. Only the pediment remains. Even the plaque has been weathered away completely, leaving only a blank monument to lost grandeur."	Adolph Sutro's little-known, geographically inaccurate, deprecated monument. 	301 Upper TerraceSan Francisco, California, 94117United States	37	-122	['MtnLady', 'richardwood401', 'kayhoskins66', 'SEANETTA', 'James', 'Ricci', 'renkessler']	2010-07-26	['Southernmost Point of the Continental U.S.', 'Zero Kilometer Stone', 'The Equator Monument', 'Old Spanish Trail Zero Milestone']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-center-of-san-francisco-monument-san-francisco-california
