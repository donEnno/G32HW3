0	Fork in the Road	['Pasadena', ' California']	384	1141	"At the otherwise unremarkable intersection of Pasadena and St. John Avenues in Pasadena, California, two local business owners decided to honor their city with a massive kitchen utensil that doubles as a clever visual gag.
The 18-foot wooden fork stands right where the roads split, literalizing the “fork in the road.” Originally placed by locals Bob Stane and Ken Marshall without the consent of the city, the statue was temporarily removed but has been replaced since the builders purchased the pertinent insurance and blessings from city officials. Since its reinstatement the giant fork has been known as a site for philanthropic efforts such as food drives."	A bigger-than-life pun that has become a beacon of altruism. 	200 Bellefontaine StPasadena, California, 91105United States	34	-118	['acheronlover', 'Oliverio', 'WickedRunR', 'Edward', 'Denny', 'Ivana', 'Viani', 'Avoiding', 'Regret']	2012-08-26	['Chained Rock', 'Miracle Pine', 'The Brutus Stone', 'Old Man of the Mountain Profiler Plaza']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fork-in-the-road
