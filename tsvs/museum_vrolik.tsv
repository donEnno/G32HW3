0	Museum Vrolik	['Amsterdam', ' Netherlands']	434	2074	"A unique and enormous collection of human and animal anatomy and pathology, the University of Amsterdam’s anatomical and embryological museum began as the private collection of Gerardus Vrolik (1775-1859) and his son Willem Vrolik (1801-1863). Both were professors of anatomy at the Athenaeum Illustre, the predecessor of the University of Amsterdam.
Willem wrote extensively on deformities, including cyclopia, the pathogenesis of congenital anomalies, and conjoined twins. His personal collection of specimens built onto that of his father, resulting in several thousand items left behind at his death.
The collection was purchased by the city of Amsterdam in 1869 and eventually found its home at the university. Other anatomical collections have been added to the museum over the years, including a collection of bone pathology, a dental collection, and other teratological specimens. There are also a number of animal specimens in the collection. The oldest specimens are from the 16th century; the newest specimens were added to the collection around 1950.
Since 2011, over 2,000 historical specimens have been on display in Museum Vrolik. The complete collection, of which about 10% is exhibited, consists of 20,000 objects."	A curious collection dedicated to human and animal anatomy and pathology. 	Meibergdreef 15Amsterdam, 1105 AZNetherlands	52	4	['Museum', 'Vrolik', 'Amsterdam', 'vrolikamc', 'gizmo', 'edwin13ok', 'museumvrolik', 'CoolCrab', 'nanobashvili', 'alison', 'mthrill', 'Henry', 'Annetta', 'Black']	2011-09-01	['Museum Boerhaave', 'Museo de Anatomopatología (Museum of Pathological Anatomy)', 'Museum of the History of Medicine', 'Brain Museum']	['Favorites']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-vrolik
