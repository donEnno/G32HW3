0	Nervous Nellie's Jams and Jellies	['Deer Isle', ' Maine']	144	764	"Nestled in the woods of Maine’s Deer Isle is an assortment of attractions that all fall under the banner of Nervous Nellie’s Jams and Jellies.
Nervous Nellie’s is a one-of-a-kind place on Deer Isle on the coast of Maine.  You can purchase homemade jams, jellies, and chutneys that are absolutely delicious and often made with local ingredients.  There’s also a cafe that is open seasonally, but you can stop by and purchase the jams and jellies even if the cafe is closed.
The real charm of the place comes from the original sculptures created on and situated throughout the premises. Created by Peter Beerits, who also lives on the grounds, the pieces are an eclectic hodgepodge of styles created in wood, metal, and glass. Beerits repurposes old farm equipment and other found materials to create figures and animals in all manner of styles,  most of them in whimsical states of repose such as the lobster and tuna playing poker or the owl and the cat in a canoe.   
In addition to the homemade jams and the outsider art, there are also three authentic buildings dating back to the 19th century. Among the small section of the Wild West there is a jail, a lawyer’s office, and a saloon. Each of the buildings has been restored to resemble its original look, providing a small living museum for visitors."	Sculptures, jams, and the wild west collide at this folksy retreat. 	598 Sunshine RdDeer Isle, Maine, 04627United States	44	-68	[]	2012-11-03	"[""'The Thief'"", 'Blenko Man', 'Parque Prehistórico', 'Musee du Santon']"	['Obscure Maine Food Finds']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/nervous-nellie-s-jams-and-jellies
