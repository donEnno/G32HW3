0	Berczy Park Dog Fountain	['Toronto', ' Ontario']	569	690	"Tucked behind Toronto’s Flatiron building (yes, New York isn’t the only one), is a whimsical, ornate fountain honoring humankind’s best friend. The fountain honors the four-legged visitors who frequent this neighborhood spot.
The three tiers of fountain include sculptures of beloved pooches, including a Great Dane puppy, a Bernese Mountain Dog, a giant Schnauzer, and a West Highland Terrier, gleefully spitting spurts of water. But dogs aren’t the only creatures you’ll find here—keep an eye out for a cat, too. 
The dogs all have their eyes glued to the giant bone that crowns the fountain. Meanwhile, the cat stares off into the distance, its gazed fixed on the two bird sculptures perched on a lampost. 
The cheery fountain is part of the park’s playful redesign by Claude Cormier and Associates. Unfortunately for the cat, the name of its breed isn’t said on the architect’s website, making it clear that this fountain really is for the dogs. The cat, which sits with a fearful expression on its face near a German Shepherd, also doesn’t partake in the water-spitting festivities.
A few of the 27 dog breeds featured at the fountain are: 
Fox Terrier, St.Bernard, Dalmatian, West Highland Terrier, Great Dane, Jack Russell Terrier, St.Bernard, Giant Schnauzer, Golden Retriever, Beagle, Pug, and the Bernese Mountain Dog just to name a few. Puppy sculptures of a few of the aforementioned breeds are also prominent at the fountain."	This whimsical fountain pays tribute to Toronto's four-legged friends. 	35 Wellington St EToronto, Ontario, M5E 1C6Canada	43	-79	['joleef', 'Cooth', 'julieamassa', 'Gavin', 'phibian79', 'bemacdougall']	2019-02-07	"[""Doris Duke's Pet Cemetery"", 'Cast-Iron Dogs of Tivoli Castle', 'Parque del Perro', 'Concrete Animal Cemetery']"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/berczy-park-dog-fountain
