0	The Venus Project	['Venus', ' Florida']	46	628	"Built in the remote countryside of central Florida on what was once a flat tomato patch, this 21-acre former research and design facility was the experimental home of an iconoclastic futurist and industrial designer named Jacque Fresco.
Constructed between 1980 and 2002, the site features 10 curvilinear and domed buildings of neo-modernistic design. The all-white buildings still retain much of their original interiors, filled with colorful cabinets and seating. Bubble windows and skylights bulge from their exterior. Original models handcrafted by Fresco himself remain on display. 
Created by Fresco to represent his vision of the future, the structures now attract visitors curious to learn about the masterplan of the self-described social engineer, who died at age 101. The location elicits a peculiar sense of both nostalgia for its past vision of the future and also of being out of place or lost in time. The complex sits in sharp contrast to its surrounding landscape filled with farms and ranches, and transitioning from its outside to its inside, or vice versa, will seem like a time warp."	The futuristic test model of an iconoclastic visionary who wanted to redesign the world. 	21 Valley LnVenus, FloridaUnited States	27	-81	[]	2019-02-27	"['Pinakothek der Moderne Futuro House', 'Woodlawn & Frank Lloyd Wright’s Pope-Leighey House', ""La Trobe's Cottage"", 'Spaceship UFO House']"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/venus-project
