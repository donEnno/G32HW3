The World’s Largest Pistachio stands 30-feet tall and was constructed using over five yards of concrete and 35 gallons of paint to give the enormous green nut a strangely real look. Like many oversized items littering the world’s highways, the pistachio is there mainly to lure motorists into the McGinn’s Pistachio Tree Ranch and Winery Gift Shop.
Unsurprisingly, there are a number of exotic, pistachio-based products for sale like chili-chocolate pistachio brittle and homemade pistachio milkshakes– although nothing is as priceless as taking a “nutty” photo under the giant snack."	This is one really big nut. 	7320 US Hwy 54-70Alamogordo, New Mexico, 88310United States	32	-105	['gezhao2004', 'breaingram', 'Keren', 'Lynn', 'esftripod', 'MAGNETs', 'vespajet', 'Molly', 'McBride', 'Jacobson', 'tylercole', 'Eirik', 'Gumeny', 'Martin', 'Rachel']	2012-09-15	"[""'World's Largest Killer Bee'"", 'Paisano Pete', 'Ohakune Carrot', 'World’s Largest Prairie Chicken']"	['10 Massively Inedible Roadside Attractions']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/world-s-largest-pistachio
