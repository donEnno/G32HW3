0	Greenacre Park	['Manhattan', ' New York']	736	2459	"At only 1/7 acre, this is one of the smallest hidden parks in the city, but it provides a nice lush place to relax and take a break from the urban landscape.
The crowning feature of the pocket park is the 25-foot waterfall, which is not only stunning, but also roars away the city noise so you’re left in a calming oasis. The park was constructed in 1971 by the Greenacre Foundation after a design by Hideo Sasaki, but it feels fresh even decades later where the honey locust trees and rare Midtown calm lure people to linger in its shade."
