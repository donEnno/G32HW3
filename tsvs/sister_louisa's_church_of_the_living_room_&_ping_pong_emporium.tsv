0	Sister Louisa's Church of the Living Room & Ping Pong Emporium	['Atlanta', ' Georgia']	348	617	"Known to its most devout patrons as Church Bar, or simply Church, this beloved institution’s walls are plastered with faux-religious pop art, velvet posters of Jesus, and pithy inspirational quotes celebrating its unique brand of defiant independence. Church is the brainchild of Grant Henry, who now goes by the moniker of Sister Louisa—a former divinity school student who opened the dive bar after growing disillusioned with theology. 
The decor draws heavily on Southern Baptist iconography, striking a delicate balance of affection and sacrilege; nativity lawn ornaments surround ping-pong tables, visitors don choir gowns while belting out church organ karaoke. Spiritual Sangria, Church’s signature drink, flows steadily through the night.
Deliberately offbeat, Church serves both faithful parishioners and those who have all but sworn off religion. The intention behind its irreverent aesthetic isn’t to offend; the religious regalia and empowering pop art, created by Henry himself, reflect a genuine fondness for the faith as it intersects with community, queer culture, and Southern identity."	A local dive where religious kitsch, Southern identity, and queer culture collide. 	466 Edgewood Ave SEAtlanta, Georgia, 30312United States	33	-84	[]	2020-06-02	"['Elfde Gebod', ""John Calvin's Chair"", 'Elliott Street Deli & Pub', 'Velvet']"	['7 Bars and Restaurants That Celebrate the LGBTQ+ Community']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sister-louisas-church-of-the-living-room-and-ping-pong-emporium
