0	The Neon Museum	['Las Vegas', ' Nevada']	1898	4518	"The neon-lit night sky of Las Vegas is one of the iconic sights of the 20th century. It is the peculiar mix of the burlesque, kitsch, and retro-modern that has marked the visual identity of an age.
Many of the most recognizable neon displays from the golden age of Las Vegas casinos have been produced by Young Electric Sign Company (YESCO). This Salt Lake City-based company has maintained a storage yard in Las Vegas for decades. This three-acre plot has, over the years, become a veritable graveyard of disused neon signs.
It is the final resting place of some notable pieces of Vegas history, like the original Aladdin’s lamp from the first version of Aladdin Casino, Binion’s Horseshoe, Silver Slipper, and the Golden Nugget.
There are over 150 decommissioned, non-restored neon signs at this location. In 2005, the La Concha Hotel, a Paul Revere Williams design, was moved up the street to serve as the museum’s visitor center."	The neon signs from Las Vegas' past find their final resting place at this unusual graveyard.  	770 Las Vegas Boulevard NorthLas Vegas, Nevada, 89101United States	36	-115	['joemontag', 'AbortionCrib', 'TheColorDana', 'katherinejhdevaney', '168lambo', 'thealexrestrepo', 'vagabondblonde', 'Drrandell', 'christineryan', 'elfandhobbit', 'Taterchips', 'jjoey2981', 'Babs81', 'ccesare', 'tonyanrob', 'sharris', 'breaingram', 'Collector', 'of', 'Experiences', 'matthewboudier', 'cirena', 'rennisk', 'JennyBenny', 'Pierre', 'Dahl', 'buffycaine99', 'renkessler', 'Avoiding', 'Regret', 'wendissima', 'Facebook1394926902', 'mbison', 'Annetta', 'Black']	2010-01-02	['Buchstabenmuseum ', 'DEVIL-ish Little Things Museum', 'The Sanctuary Museum', 'Buddha Dordenma Statue']	"[""Leonardo Nam's 16 Quirky Roadside Attractions"", ""A 'No Regrets' Tour With One of Our Top Photo Contributors"", ""The World's Top 100 Wonders in 2018"", 'Favorites', ""The World's Most Unusual Displays of Neon""]"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/neon-boneyard
