0	Musée des Arts Forains 	['Paris', ' France']	403	2622	"This museum of antique carnival objects invites you to ride on century-old carousels and experience the wonder of amusement attractions from 1850 to 1950. 
The museum, which opened in 1996, is sourced from the private collection of Jean-Paul Favand, an actor and dealer of antiquities. It includes such vintage carnival items as wooden carousels, fair stalls, German swings, and a Hooghuys Organ. Best of all, you can play a carnival game and even ride on some of the rides, such as the “Manège vélocipédique” from 1897, a carousel of bicycles powered by the pedaling of its riders. 
The museum is open only by reservation or by attending one of the scheduled seasonal tours."	A museum of carnival attractions where you are invited to ride the rides. 	53 Avenue des Terroirs de FranceParis, 75012France	48	2	[]	2013-03-31	['International Clown Hall of Fame', 'Circus World Museum', 'Booze History Museum', 'Stazione Neapolis']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/musee-des-arts-forains
