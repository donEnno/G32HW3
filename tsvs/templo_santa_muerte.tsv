0	Templo Santa Muerte	['Los Angeles', ' California']	173	1277	"In an innocuous L.A. storefront the Templo Santa Muerte honors the Mexican skeleton saint of death.
This one-room temple was established around 2006 by Father Garcia and his wife Sahara. It’s dedicated to Santa Muerte, a Mexican folk saint that is usually depicted as a female skeleton wearing a colorful robe. It’s a small congregation, but very welcoming to newcomers including families with children. 
Templo Santa Muerte invites offerings of fresh flowers, candies, cigars and tequila, as well as the more traditional cash. There is also a small bótanica that sells candles and worship aids."
