0	Paved Trail	['Cooksburg', ' Pennsylvania']	68	695	"This short loop trail looks like something out of a fairytale. The verdant walkway may be one of the most magical paths in Pennsylvania.
The official name for this part of Cook Forest State Park is the “Paved Trail.” But because the walkway is often carpeted by green moss, it’s known locally as the “Emerald Path.”
The trail is only about a quarter of a mile long. It’s a sweet little loop that’s accessible to everyone, making it so those of all physical abilities can enjoy the beauty of this Old Growth forest.
Stepping past the trail sign into the trees was like stepping into a storybook landscape. The trail looks like it’s been reclaimed by nature, as if it’s an ancient, forgotten part of the forest (though it was only built in the 1970s). Log benches dot its edges, adding to the charm."	"Locals call this magical moss-covered walkway the ""Emerald Path."" "	State Rte 1015Cooksburg, Pennsylvania, 16217United States	41	-79	[]	2019-08-12	"[""The 'Wise Old Men' of El Gallineral Park"", 'Pygmy Forest Trail', 'Brea Redwood Grove', 'Cerro de las Campanas (Hill of Bells)']"		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/paved-trail
