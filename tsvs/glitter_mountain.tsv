It’s still deeded to the mine owners, though it’s managed by the Bureau of Land Management.  It has a brief history and synopsis of selenite and its uses. 
It’s possible to wander among the small selenite deposits sparkling along the edges of the small pit. It’s a fun and interesting little adventure site suitable for the whole family."	This old selenite mine is dotted with tiny crystals that make it shimmer like it's covered in glitter. 	Old Gypsum Crystal MineLittlefield, Arizona, 86432United States	36	-113	[]	2019-04-29	['Yuncheng Salt Lake', 'Pokaini Forest ', 'Pertosa Caves', 'Waw an Namus']		https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/glitter-mountain
