0	The Flower Fields	['Carlsbad', ' California']	842	1739	"On a hillside overlooking the Pacific, the Flower Fields in Carlsbad, California, bloom into life each March with a vibrant show of color. 
Along with nearby Encinitas, Carlsbad has long been a major center for the commercial flower industry, with the Flower Fields just a small part. The ranunculus planted on the 50 acres of the Flower Fields are grown for their bulbs, but have become a seasonal destination in their own right.
Visitors are welcome to walk amongst the surreal spectacle of seemingly endless blooms, or jump aboard an antique tractor ride. Either way is like plunging into a rainbow."	Stripes of flowers bloom each spring in a 50 acre rainbow of color. 	5704 Paseo Del NorteCarlsbad, California, 92008United States	33	-117	[]	2013-12-27	['Cactus Thiemann', 'Fragas do Eume', 'Drago Milenario', 'Anping Tree House']	['12 Places That Look Like Desserts']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-flower-fields-carlsbad-california
