Festive decorations still linger near the haunting rides for the planned May 1, 1986 opening that never came. Its looming ferris wheel has become an unsettling icon of the nuclear disaster, and visitors sometimes leave stuffed animals in its cars as a memorial. The park still contains varying levels of radiation, although the concrete areas are mostly safe. The area under the ferris wheel has some of the highest levels of radiation in the amusement park.
There is also an abandoned bumper-car ride, with most rides still fully intact."	This attraction was abandoned after the Chernobyl disaster.Â 	Sportyvna StreetPripyatUkraine	51	30	['Johan', 'SWE', 'ree', 'no', 'skree', 'no', '10011', 'ree', 'no', 'no', '1000', '1000', 'Abandoned', 'dab', 'sxjoCS9hFfe9uef', '9pef9fe', 'ihgehigEFhFEHFHIfEih', 'mauricekirschbaum', 'MagnumPI', 'Carismarkus', 'emmastargirl', 'chernobaevlucy', 'Fragglehunter', 'hana', 'mcfly1518', 'evanbuhler', 'Avoiding', 'Regret', 'Annetta', 'Black']	2013-01-20	"[""SkyPark at Santa's Village"", 'Abandoned City of Pripyat', 'Picher', 'Love Canal Containment Zone']"	"['A World Tour of Abandoned Amusement Parks', ""A 'No Regrets' Tour With One of Our Top Photo Contributors""]"	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pripyat-amusement-park
